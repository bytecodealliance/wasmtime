;; Tests that cancellation works with the async threading intrinsics.
;; Consists of two components, C and D. C implements functions that mix cancellable and uncancellable yields and suspensions. 
;; D calls these functions and cancels the resulting subtasks, ensuring that cancellation is only seen when expected.

;; -- Component C --

;; `run-yield`: Yields twice, first with an uncancellable yield, then with a cancellable yield.
;;      The caller cancels the subtask during the first yield, and ensures that the cancellation only takes effect
;;      on the second yield.

;; `run-yield-to`: Yields twice to a spawned thread, first with an uncancellable yield, then with a cancellable yield.
;;      A complication is that we can't guarantee that if the spawned thread yields, the supertask will be scheduled to
;;      cancel the subtask before the subtask's implicit thread is rescheduled. To handle this, the subtask's implicit
;;      thread first waits on a future to be written by the supertask, then yields to the spawned thread.

;; `run-suspend`: More complex, because executing an uncancellable suspension requires another
;;      thread in the same subtask to explicitly wake it up. This is done by the subtask spawning a new thread that
;;      waits on a future to be written by the supertask, and then resumes the main thread once that happens.
;;      After setting up this thread, `run-suspend` performs an uncancellable suspend, then a cancellable suspend.
;;      The caller cancels the subtask during the first suspend, writes to the future to make the spawned thread
;;      resume the implicit thread, and ensures that the cancellation only takes effect on the second suspend.

;; `run-switch-to`: Similar to `run-suspend`, but uses `thread.switch-to` instead of `thread.suspend`.

;; -- Component D --

;; `run-test`: Calls one of the functions in C based on a test id, cancels the resulting subtask, and ensures that
;;      cancellation is only seen when expected.

;; `run`: Calls `run-test` for each of the functions in C.

/// One "input symbol" for the decision tree that handles matching on
/// a term. Each symbol represents one step: we either run a match op,
/// or we finish the match.
///
/// Note that in the original Peepmatic scheme, the input-symbol to
/// the FSM was specified slightly differently. The automaton
/// responded to alphabet symbols that corresponded only to match
/// results, and the "extra state" was used at each automaton node to
/// represent the op to run next. This extra state differentiated
/// nodes that would otherwise be merged together by
/// deduplication. That scheme works well enough, but the "extra
/// state" is slightly confusing and diverges slightly from a pure
/// automaton.
///
/// Instead, here, we imagine that the user of the automaton/trie can
/// query the possible transition edges out of the current state. Each
/// of these edges corresponds to one possible match op to run. After
/// running a match op, we reach a new state corresponding to
/// successful matches up to that point.
///
/// However, it's a bit more subtle than this. Consider the
/// prioritization problem. We want to give the DSL user the ability
/// to change the order in which rules apply, for example to have a
/// tier of "fallback rules" that apply only if more custom rules do
/// not match.
///
/// A somewhat simplistic answer to this problem is "more specific
/// rule wins". However, this implies the existence of a total
/// ordering of linearized match sequences that may not fully capture
/// the intuitive meaning of "more specific". Consider three left-hand
/// sides:
///
/// - (A _ _)
/// - (A (B _) _)
/// - (A _ (B _))
///
/// Intuitively, the first is the least specific. Given the input `(A
/// (B 1) (B 2))`, we can say for sure that the first should not be
/// chosen, because either the second or third would match "more" of
/// the input tree. But which of the second and third should be
/// chosen? A "lexicographic ordering" rule would say that we sort
/// left-hand sides such that the `(B _)` sub-pattern comes before the
/// wildcard `_`, so the second rule wins. But that is arbitrarily
/// privileging one over the other based on the order of the
/// arguments.
///
/// Instead, we can accept explicit priorities from the user to allow
/// either choice. So we need a data structure that can associate
/// matching inputs *with priorities* to outputs.
///
/// Next, we build a decision tree rather than an FSM. Why? Because
/// we're compiling to a structured language, Rust, and states become
/// *program points* rather than *data*, we cannot easily support a
/// DAG structure. In other words, we are not producing a FSM that we
/// can interpret at runtime; rather we are compiling code in which
/// each state corresponds to a sequence of statements and
/// control-flow that branches to a next state, we naturally need
/// nesting; we cannot codegen arbitrary state transitions in an
/// efficient manner. We could support a limited form of DAG that
/// reifies "diamonds" (two alternate paths that reconverge), but
/// supporting this in a way that lets the output refer to values from
/// either side is very complex (we need to invent phi-nodes), and the
/// cases where we want to do this rather than invoke a sub-term (that
/// is compiled to a separate function) are rare. Finally, note that
/// one reason to deduplicate nodes and turn a tree back into a DAG --
/// "output-suffix sharing" as some other instruction-rewriter
/// engines, such as Peepmatic, do -- is not done, because all
/// "output" occurs at leaf nodes; this is necessary because we do not
/// want to start invoking external constructors until we are sure of
/// the match. Some of the code-sharing advantages of the "suffix
/// sharing" scheme can be obtained in a more flexible and
/// user-controllable way (with less understanding of internal
/// compiler logic needed) by factoring logic into different internal
/// terms, which become different compiled functions. This is likely
/// to happen anyway as part of good software engineering practice.
///
/// We prepare for codegen by building a "prioritized trie", where the
/// trie associates input strings with priorities to output values.
/// Each input string is a sequence of match operators followed by an
/// "end of match" token, and each output is a sequence of ops that
/// build the output expression. Each input-output mapping is
/// associated with a priority. The goal of the trie is to generate a
/// decision-tree procedure that lets us execute match ops in a
/// deterministic way, eventually landing at a state that corresponds
/// to the highest-priority matching rule and can produce the output.
///
/// To build this trie, we construct nodes with edges to child nodes;
/// each edge consists of (i) one input token (a `PatternInst` or
/// EOM), and (ii) the priority of rules along this edge. We do not
/// merge rules of different priorities, because the logic to do so is
/// complex and error-prone, necessitating "splits" when we merge
/// together a set of rules over a priority range but later introduce
/// a new possible match op in the "middle" of the range. (E.g., match
/// op A at prio 10, B at prio 5, A at prio 0.) In fact, a previous
/// version of the ISLE compiler worked this way, but in practice the
/// complexity was unneeded.
///
/// To add a rule to this trie, we perform the usual trie-insertion
/// logic, creating edges and subnodes where necessary. A new edge is
/// necessary whenever an edge does not exist for the (priority,
/// symbol) tuple.
///
/// Note that this means that multiple edges with a single match-op
/// may exist, with different priorities.

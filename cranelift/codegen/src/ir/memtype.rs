//! Definitions for "memory types" in CLIF.
//!
//! A memory type is a struct-like definition -- fields with offsets,
//! each field having a type and possibly an attached fact -- that we
//! can use in proof-carrying code to validate accesses to structs and
//! propagate facts onto the loaded values as well.
//!
//! Memory types are meant to be rich enough to describe the *layout*
//! of values in memory, but do not necessarily need to embody
//! higher-level features such as subtyping directly. Rather, they
//! should encode an implementation of a type or object system.
//!
//! Note also that it is a non-goal for now for this type system to be
//! "complete" or fully orthogonal: we have some restrictions now
//! (e.g., struct fields are only primitives) because this is all we
//! need for existing PCC applications, and it keeps the
//! implementation simpler.
//!
//! There are a few basic kinds of types:
//!
//! - A struct is an aggregate of fields and an overall size. Each
//!   field has a *primitive Cranelift type*. This is for simplicity's
//!   sake: we do not allow nested memory types because to do so
//!   invites cycles, requires recursive computation of sizes, creates
//!   complicated questions when field types are dynamically-sized,
//!   and in general is more complexity than we need.
//!
//!   The expectation (validated by PCC) is that when a checked load
//!   or store accesses memory typed by a memory type, accesses will
//!   only be to fields at offsets named in the type, and will be via
//!   the given Cranelift type -- i.e., no type-punning occurs in
//!   memory.
//!
//!   The overall size of the struct may be larger than that implied
//!   by the fields because (i) we may not want or need to name all
//!   the actually-existing fields in the memory type, and (ii) there
//!   may be alignment padding that we also don't want or need to
//!   represent explicitly.
//!
//! - A static memory is an untyped blob of storage with a static
//!   size. This is memory that can be accessed with any type of load
//!   or store at any valid offset.
//!
//!   Note that this is *distinct* from an "array of u8" kind of
//!   representation of memory, if/when we can represent such a thing,
//!   because the expectation with memory types' fields (including
//!   array elements) is that they are strongly typed, only accessed
//!   via that type, and not type-punned. We don't want to imply any
//!   restriction on load/store size, or any actual structure, with
//!   untyped memory; it's just a blob.
//!
//! Eventually we plan to also have:
//!
//! - A dynamic array is a sequence of struct memory types, with a
//!   length given by a global value (GV). This is useful to model,
//!   e.g., tables.
//!
//! - A discriminated union is a union of several memory types
//!   together with a tag field. This will be useful to model and
//!   verify subtyping/downcasting for Wasm GC, among other uses.
//!
//! - Nullability on pointer fields: the fact will hold only if the
//!   field is not null (all zero bits).

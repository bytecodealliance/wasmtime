//! Instruction Set Architectures.
//!
//! The `isa` module provides a `TargetIsa` trait which provides the behavior specialization needed
//! by the ISA-independent code generator. The sub-modules of this module provide definitions for
//! the instruction sets that Cranelift can target. Each sub-module has it's own implementation of
//! `TargetIsa`.
//!
//! # Constructing a `TargetIsa` instance
//!
//! The target ISA is built from the following information:
//!
//! - The name of the target ISA as a string. Cranelift is a cross-compiler, so the ISA to target
//!   can be selected dynamically. Individual ISAs can be left out when Cranelift is compiled, so a
//!   string is used to identify the proper sub-module.
//! - Values for settings that apply to all ISAs. This is represented by a `settings::Flags`
//!   instance.
//! - Values for ISA-specific settings.
//!
//! The `isa::lookup()` function is the main entry point which returns an `isa::Builder`
//! appropriate for the requested ISA:
//!
//! ```
//! # #[macro_use] extern crate target_lexicon;
//! use cranelift_codegen::isa;
//! use cranelift_codegen::settings::{self, Configurable};
//! use std::str::FromStr;
//! use target_lexicon::Triple;
//!
//! let shared_builder = settings::builder();
//! let shared_flags = settings::Flags::new(shared_builder);
//!
//! match isa::lookup(triple!("x86_64")) {
//!     Err(_) => {
//!         // The x86_64 target ISA is not available.
//!     }
//!     Ok(mut isa_builder) => {
//!         isa_builder.set("use_popcnt", "on");
//!         let isa = isa_builder.finish(shared_flags);
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The configured target ISA trait object is a `Box<TargetIsa>` which can be used for multiple
//! concurrent function compilations.

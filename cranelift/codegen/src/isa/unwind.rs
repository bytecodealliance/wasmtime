/// Unwind pseudoinstruction used in VCode backends: represents that
/// at the present location, an action has just been taken.
///
/// VCode backends always emit unwind info that is relative to a frame
/// pointer, because we are planning to allow for dynamic frame allocation,
/// and because it makes the design quite a lot simpler in general: we don't
/// have to be precise about SP adjustments throughout the body of the function.
///
/// We include only unwind info for prologues at this time. Note that unwind
/// info for epilogues is only necessary if one expects to unwind while within
/// the last few instructions of the function (after FP has been restored) or
/// if one wishes to instruction-step through the epilogue and see a backtrace
/// at every point. This is not necessary for correct operation otherwise and so
/// we simplify the world a bit by omitting epilogue information. (Note that
/// some platforms also don't require or have a way to describe unwind
/// information for epilogues at all: for example, on Windows, the `UNWIND_INFO`
/// format only stores information for the function prologue.)
///
/// Because we are defining an abstraction over multiple unwind formats (at
/// least Windows/fastcall and System V) and multiple architectures (at least
/// x86-64 and aarch64), we have to be a little bit flexible in how we describe
/// the frame. However, it turns out that a least-common-denominator prologue
/// works for all of the cases we have to worry about today!
///
/// We assume the stack looks something like this:
///
///
/// ```plain
///                  +----------------------------------------------+
///                  | stack arg area, etc (according to ABI)       |
///                  | ...                                          |
///   SP at call --> +----------------------------------------------+
///                  | return address (pushed by HW or SW)          |
///                  +----------------------------------------------+
///                  | old frame pointer (FP)                       |
///   FP in this --> +----------------------------------------------+
///   function       | clobbered callee-save registers              |
///                  | ...                                          |
///   start of   --> +----------------------------------------------+
///   clobbers       | (rest of function's frame, irrelevant here)  |
///                  | ...                                          |
///   SP in this --> +----------------------------------------------+
///   function
/// ```
///
/// We assume that the prologue consists of:
///
/// * `PushFrameRegs`: A push operation that adds the old FP to the stack (and
///    maybe the link register, on architectures that do not push return addresses
///    in hardware)
/// * `DefineFrame`: An update that sets FP to SP to establish a new frame
/// * `SaveReg`: A number of stores or pushes to the stack to save clobbered registers
///
/// Each of these steps has a corresponding pseudo-instruction. At each step,
/// we need some information to determine where the current stack frame is
/// relative to SP or FP. When the `PushFrameRegs` occurs, we need to know how
/// much SP was decremented by, so we can allow the unwinder to continue to find
/// the caller's frame. When we define the new frame, we need to know where FP
/// is in relation to "SP at call" and also "start of clobbers", because
/// different unwind formats define one or the other of those as the anchor by
/// which we define the frame. Finally, when registers are saved, we need to
/// know which ones, and where.
///
/// Different unwind formats work differently; here is a whirlwind tour of how
/// they define frames to help understanding:
///
/// - Windows unwind information defines a frame that must start below the
///   clobber area, because all clobber-save offsets are non-negative. We set it
///   at the "start of clobbers" in the figure above. The `UNWIND_INFO` contains
///   a "frame pointer offset" field; when we define the new frame, the frame is
///   understood to be the value of FP (`RBP`) *minus* this offset. In other
///   words, the FP is *at the frame pointer offset* relative to the
///   start-of-clobber-frame. We use the "FP offset down to clobber area" offset
///   to generate this info.
///
/// - System V unwind information defines a frame in terms of the CFA
///   (call-frame address), which is equal to the "SP at call" above. SysV
///   allows negative offsets, so there is no issue defining clobber-save
///   locations in terms of CFA. The format allows us to define CFA flexibly in
///   terms of any register plus an offset; we define it in terms of FP plus
///   the clobber-to-caller-SP offset once FP is established.
///
/// Note that certain architectures impose limits on offsets: for example, on
/// Windows, the base of the clobber area must not be more than 240 bytes below
/// FP.
///
/// Unwind pseudoinstructions are emitted inline by ABI code as it generates
/// a prologue. Thus, for the usual case, a prologue might look like (using x64
/// as an example):
///
/// ```plain
/// push rbp
/// unwind UnwindInst::PushFrameRegs { offset_upward_to_caller_sp: 16 }
/// mov rbp, rsp
/// unwind UnwindInst::DefineNewFrame { offset_upward_to_caller_sp: 16,
///                                     offset_downward_to_clobbers: 16 }
/// sub rsp, 32
/// mov [rsp+16], r12
/// unwind UnwindInst::SaveReg { reg: R12, clobber_offset: 0 }
/// mov [rsp+24], r13
/// unwind UnwindInst::SaveReg { reg: R13, clobber_offset: 8 }
/// ...
/// ```

//! Implementation of a vanilla ABI, shared between several machines. The
//! implementation here assumes that arguments will be passed in registers
//! first, then additional args on the stack; that the stack grows downward,
//! contains a standard frame (return address and frame pointer), and the
//! compiler is otherwise free to allocate space below that with its choice of
//! layout; and that the machine has some notion of caller- and callee-save
//! registers. Most modern machines, e.g. x86-64 and AArch64, should fit this
//! mold and thus both of these backends use this shared implementation.
//!
//! See the documentation in specific machine backends for the "instantiation"
//! of this generic ABI, i.e., which registers are caller/callee-save, arguments
//! and return values, and any other special requirements.
//!
//! For now the implementation here assumes a 64-bit machine, but we intend to
//! make this 32/64-bit-generic shortly.
//!
//! # Vanilla ABI
//!
//! First, arguments and return values are passed in registers up to a certain
//! fixed count, after which they overflow onto the stack. Multiple return
//! values either fit in registers, or are returned in a separate return-value
//! area on the stack, given by a hidden extra parameter.
//!
//! Note that the exact stack layout is up to us. We settled on the
//! below design based on several requirements. In particular, we need to be
//! able to generate instructions (or instruction sequences) to access
//! arguments, stack slots, and spill slots before we know how many spill slots
//! or clobber-saves there will be, because of our pass structure. We also
//! prefer positive offsets to negative offsets because of an asymmetry in
//! some machines' addressing modes (e.g., on AArch64, positive offsets have a
//! larger possible range without a long-form sequence to synthesize an
//! arbitrary offset). Finally, it is not allowed to access memory below the
//! current SP value.
//!
//! We assume that a prologue first pushes the frame pointer (and return address
//! above that, if the machine does not do that in hardware). We set FP to point
//! to this two-word frame record. We store all other frame slots below this
//! two-word frame record, with the stack pointer remaining at or below this
//! fixed frame storage for the rest of the function. We can then access frame
//! storage slots using positive offsets from SP. In order to allow codegen for
//! the latter before knowing how many clobber-saves we have, and also allow it
//! while SP is being adjusted to set up a call, we implement a "nominal SP"
//! tracking feature by which a fixup (distance between actual SP and a
//! "nominal" SP) is known at each instruction.
//!
//! # Stack Layout
//!
//! The stack looks like:
//!
//! ```plain
//!   (high address)
//!
//!                              +---------------------------+

//!
//! # Multi-value Returns
//!
//! Note that we support multi-value returns in two ways. First, we allow for
//! multiple return-value registers. Second, if teh appropriate flag is set, we
//! support the SpiderMonkey Wasm ABI.  For details of the multi-value return
//! ABI, see:
//!
//! https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/bc3600def806859c31b2c7ac06e3d69271052a89/js/src/wasm/WasmStubs.h#134
//!
//! In brief:
//! - Return values are processed in *reverse* order.
//! - The first return value in this order (so the last return) goes into the
//!   ordinary return register.
//! - Any further returns go in a struct-return area, allocated upwards (in
//!   address order) during the reverse traversal.
//! - This struct-return area is provided by the caller, and a pointer to its
//!   start is passed as an invisible last (extra) argument. Normally the caller
//!   will allocate this area on the stack. When we generate calls, we place it
//!   just above the on-stack argument area.
//! - So, for example, a function returning 4 i64's (v0, v1, v2, v3), with no
//!   formal arguments, would:
//!   - Accept a pointer `P` to the struct return area as a hidden argument in the
//!     first argument register on entry.
//!   - Return v3 in the one and only return-value register.
//!   - Return v2 in memory at `[P]`.
//!   - Return v1 in memory at `[P+8]`.
//!   - Return v0 in memory at `[P+16]`.

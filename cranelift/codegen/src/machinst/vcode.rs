//! This implements the VCode container: a CFG of Insts that have been lowered.
//!
//! VCode is virtual-register code. An instruction in VCode is almost a machine
//! instruction; however, its register slots can refer to virtual registers in
//! addition to real machine registers.
//!
//! VCode is structured with traditional basic blocks, and
//! each block must be terminated by an unconditional branch (one target), a
//! conditional branch (two targets), or a return (no targets). Note that this
//! slightly differs from the machine code of most ISAs: in most ISAs, a
//! conditional branch has one target (and the not-taken case falls through).
//! However, we expect that machine backends will elide branches to the following
//! block (i.e., zero-offset jumps), and will be able to codegen a branch-cond /
//! branch-uncond pair if *both* targets are not fallthrough. This allows us to
//! play with layout prior to final binary emission, as well, if we want.
//!
//! See the main module comment in `mod.rs` for more details on the VCode-based
//! backend pipeline.

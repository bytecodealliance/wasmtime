//! Computation of basic block order in emitted code.
//!
//! This module handles the translation from CLIF BBs to VCode BBs.
//!
//! The basic idea is that we compute a sequence of "lowered blocks" that
//! correspond to one or more blocks in the graph: (CLIF CFG) `union` (implicit
//! block on *every* edge). Conceptually, the lowering pipeline wants to insert
//! moves for phi-nodes on every block-to-block transfer; these blocks always
//! conceptually exist, but may be merged with an "original" CLIF block (and
//! hence not actually exist; this is equivalent to inserting the blocks only on
//! critical edges).
//!
//! In other words, starting from a CFG like this (where each "CLIF block" and
//! "(edge N->M)" is a separate basic block):
//!
//! ```plain
//!
//!              CLIF block 0
//!               /           \
//!       (edge 0->1)         (edge 0->2)
//!              |                |
//!       CLIF block 1         CLIF block 2
//!              \                /
//!           (edge 1->3)   (edge 2->3)
//!                   \      /
//!                 CLIF block 3
//! ```
//!
//! We can produce a CFG of lowered blocks like so:
//!
//! ```plain
//!            +--------------+
//!            | CLIF block 0 |
//!            +--------------+
//!               /           \
//!     +--------------+     +--------------+
//!     | (edge 0->1)  |     |(edge 0->2)   |
//!     | CLIF block 1 |     | CLIF block 2 |
//!     +--------------+     +--------------+
//!              \                /
//!          +-----------+ +-----------+
//!          |(edge 1->3)| |(edge 2->3)|
//!          +-----------+ +-----------+
//!                   \      /
//!                +------------+
//!                |CLIF block 3|
//!                +------------+
//! ```
//!
//! (note that the edges into CLIF blocks 1 and 2 could be merged with those
//! blocks' original bodies, but the out-edges could not because for simplicity
//! in the successor-function definition, we only ever merge an edge onto one
//! side of an original CLIF block.)
//!
//! Each `LoweredBlock` names just an original CLIF block, an original CLIF
//! block prepended or appended with an edge block (never both, though), or just
//! an edge block.
//!
//! To compute this lowering, we do a DFS over the CLIF-plus-edge-block graph
//! (never actually materialized, just defined by a "successors" function), and
//! compute the reverse postorder.
//!
//! This algorithm isn't perfect w.r.t. generated code quality: we don't, for
//! example, consider any information about whether edge blocks will actually
//! have content, because this computation happens as part of lowering *before*
//! regalloc, and regalloc may or may not insert moves/spills/reloads on any
//! particular edge. But it works relatively well and is conceptually simple.
//! Furthermore, the [MachBuffer] machine-code sink performs final peephole-like
//! branch editing that in practice elides empty blocks and simplifies some of
//! the other redundancies that this scheme produces.

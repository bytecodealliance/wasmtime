//! This module exposes the machine-specific backend definition pieces.
//!
//! The MachInst infrastructure is the compiler backend, from CLIF
//! (ir::Function) to machine code. The purpose of this infrastructure is, at a
//! high level, to do instruction selection/lowering (to machine instructions),
//! register allocation, and then perform all the fixups to branches, constant
//! data references, etc., needed to actually generate machine code.
//!
//! The container for machine instructions, at various stages of construction,
//! is the `VCode` struct. We refer to a sequence of machine instructions organized
//! into basic blocks as "vcode". This is short for "virtual-register code", though
//! it's a bit of a misnomer because near the end of the pipeline, vcode has all
//! real registers. Nevertheless, the name is catchy and we like it.
//!
//! The compilation pipeline, from an `ir::Function` (already optimized as much as
//! you like by machine-independent optimization passes) onward, is as follows.
//! (N.B.: though we show the VCode separately at each stage, the passes
//! mutate the VCode in place; these are not separate copies of the code.)
//!
//! ```plain

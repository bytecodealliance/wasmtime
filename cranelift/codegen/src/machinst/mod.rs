//! This module exposes the machine-specific backend definition pieces.
//!
//! The MachInst infrastructure is the compiler backend, from CLIF
//! (ir::Function) to machine code. The purpose of this infrastructure is, at a
//! high level, to do instruction selection/lowering (to machine instructions),
//! register allocation, and then perform all the fixups to branches, constant
//! data references, etc., needed to actually generate machine code.
//!
//! The container for machine instructions, at various stages of construction,
//! is the `VCode` struct. We refer to a sequence of machine instructions organized
//! into basic blocks as "vcode". This is short for "virtual-register code".
//!
//! The compilation pipeline, from an `ir::Function` (already optimized as much as
//! you like by machine-independent optimization passes) onward, is as follows.
//!
//! ```plain
//!
//!     ir::Function                (SSA IR, machine-independent opcodes)
//!         |
//!         |  [lower]
//!         |
//!     VCode<arch_backend::Inst>   (machine instructions:
//!         |                        - mostly virtual registers.
//!         |                        - cond branches in two-target form.
//!         |                        - branch targets are block indices.
//!         |                        - in-memory constants held by insns,
//!         |                          with unknown offsets.
//!         |                        - critical edges (actually all edges)
//!         |                          are split.)
//!         |
//!         | [regalloc --> `regalloc2::Output`; VCode is unchanged]
//!         |
//!         | [binary emission via MachBuffer]
//!         |
//!     Vec<u8>                     (machine code:
//!         |                        - two-dest branches resolved via
//!         |                          streaming branch resolution/simplification.
//!         |                        - regalloc `Allocation` results used directly
//!         |                          by instruction emission code.

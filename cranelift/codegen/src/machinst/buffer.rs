//! In-memory representation of compiled machine code, with labels and fixups to
//! refer to those labels. Handles constant-pool island insertion and also
//! veneer insertion for out-of-range jumps.
//!
//! This code exists to solve three problems:
//!
//! - Branch targets for forward branches are not known until later, when we
//!   emit code in a single pass through the instruction structs.
//!
//! - On many architectures, address references or offsets have limited range.
//!   For example, on AArch64, conditional branches can only target code +/- 1MB
//!   from the branch itself.
//!
//! - The lowering of control flow from the CFG-with-edges produced by
//!   [BlockLoweringOrder](super::BlockLoweringOrder), combined with many empty
//!   edge blocks when the register allocator does not need to insert any
//!   spills/reloads/moves in edge blocks, results in many suboptimal branch
//!   patterns. The lowering also pays no attention to block order, and so
//!   two-target conditional forms (cond-br followed by uncond-br) can often by
//!   avoided because one of the targets is the fallthrough. There are several
//!   cases here where we can simplify to use fewer branches.
//!
//! This "buffer" implements a single-pass code emission strategy (with a later
//! "fixup" pass, but only through recorded fixups, not all instructions). The
//! basic idea is:
//!
//! - Emit branches as they are, including two-target (cond/uncond) compound
//!   forms, but with zero offsets and optimistically assuming the target will be
//!   in range. Record the "fixup" for later. Targets are denoted instead by
//!   symbolic "labels" that are then bound to certain offsets in the buffer as
//!   we emit code. (Nominally, there is a label at the start of every basic
//!   block.)
//!
//! - As we do this, track the offset in the buffer at which the first label
//!   reference "goes out of range". We call this the "deadline". If we reach the
//!   deadline and we still have not bound the label to which an unresolved branch
//!   refers, we have a problem!
//!
//! - To solve this problem, we emit "islands" full of "veneers". An island is
//!   simply a chunk of code inserted in the middle of the code actually produced
//!   by the emitter (e.g., vcode iterating over instruction structs). The emitter
//!   has some awareness of this: it either asks for an island between blocks, so
//!   it is not accidentally executed, or else it emits a branch around the island
//!   when all other options fail (see `Inst::EmitIsland` meta-instruction).
//!
//! - A "veneer" is an instruction (or sequence of instructions) in an "island"
//!   that implements a longer-range reference to a label. The idea is that, for
//!   example, a branch with a limited range can branch to a "veneer" instead,
//!   which is simply a branch in a form that can use a longer-range reference. On
//!   AArch64, for example, conditionals have a +/- 1 MB range, but a conditional
//!   can branch to an unconditional branch which has a +/- 128 MB range. Hence, a
//!   conditional branch's label reference can be fixed up with a "veneer" to
//!   achieve a longer range.
//!
//! - To implement all of this, we require the backend to provide a `LabelUse`
//!   type that implements a trait. This is nominally an enum that records one of
//!   several kinds of references to an offset in code -- basically, a relocation
//!   type -- and will usually correspond to different instruction formats. The
//!   `LabelUse` implementation specifies the maximum range, how to patch in the
//!   actual label location when known, and how to generate a veneer to extend the
//!   range.
//!
//! That satisfies label references, but we still may have suboptimal branch
//! patterns. To clean up the branches, we do a simple "peephole"-style
//! optimization on the fly. To do so, the emitter (e.g., `Inst::emit()`)
//! informs the buffer of branches in the code and, in the case of conditionals,
//! the code that would have been emitted to invert this branch's condition. We
//! track the "latest branches": these are branches that are contiguous up to
//! the current offset. (If any code is emitted after a branch, that branch or
//! run of contiguous branches is no longer "latest".) The latest branches are
//! those that we can edit by simply truncating the buffer and doing something
//! else instead.
//!
//! To optimize branches, we implement several simple rules, and try to apply
//! them to the "latest branches" when possible:
//!
//! - A branch with a label target, when that label is bound to the ending
//!   offset of the branch (the fallthrough location), can be removed altogether,
//!   because the branch would have no effect).
//!
//! - An unconditional branch that starts at a label location, and branches to
//!   another label, results in a "label alias": all references to the label bound
//!   *to* this branch instruction are instead resolved to the *target* of the
//!   branch instruction. This effectively removes empty blocks that just
//!   unconditionally branch to the next block. We call this "branch threading".
//!
//! - A conditional followed by an unconditional, when the conditional branches
//!   to the unconditional's fallthrough, results in (i) the truncation of the
//!   unconditional, (ii) the inversion of the condition's condition, and (iii)
//!   replacement of the conditional's target (using the original target of the
//!   unconditional). This is a fancy way of saying "we can flip a two-target
//!   conditional branch's taken/not-taken targets if it works better with our
//!   fallthrough". To make this work, the emitter actually gives the buffer
//!   *both* forms of every conditional branch: the true form is emitted into the
//!   buffer, and the "inverted" machine-code bytes are provided as part of the
//!   branch-fixup metadata.
//!
//! - An unconditional B preceded by another unconditional P, when B's label(s) have
//!   been redirected to target(B), can be removed entirely. This is an extension
//!   of the branch-threading optimization, and is valid because if we know there
//!   will be no fallthrough into this branch instruction (the prior instruction
//!   is an unconditional jump), and if we know we have successfully redirected
//!   all labels, then this branch instruction is unreachable. Note that this
//!   works because the redirection happens before the label is ever resolved
//!   (fixups happen at island emission time, at which point latest-branches are
//!   cleared, or at the end of emission), so we are sure to catch and redirect
//!   all possible paths to this instruction.
//!
//! # Branch-optimization Correctness
//!
//! The branch-optimization mechanism depends on a few data structures with
//! invariants, which are always held outside the scope of top-level public
//! methods:
//!
//! - The latest-branches list. Each entry describes a span of the buffer
//!   (start/end offsets), the label target, the corresponding fixup-list entry
//!   index, and the bytes (must be the same length) for the inverted form, if
//!   conditional. The list of labels that are bound to the start-offset of this
//!   branch is *complete* (if any label has a resolved offset equal to `start`
//!   and is not an alias, it must appear in this list) and *precise* (no label
//!   in this list can be bound to another offset). No label in this list should
//!   be an alias.  No two branch ranges can overlap, and branches are in
//!   ascending-offset order.
//!
//! - The labels-at-tail list. This contains all MachLabels that have been bound
//!   to (whose resolved offsets are equal to) the tail offset of the buffer.
//!   No label in this list should be an alias.
//!
//! - The label_offsets array, containing the bound offset of a label or
//!   UNKNOWN. No label can be bound at an offset greater than the current
//!   buffer tail.
//!
//! - The label_aliases array, containing another label to which a label is
//!   bound or UNKNOWN. A label's resolved offset is the resolved offset
//!   of the label it is aliased to, if this is set.
//!
//! We argue below, at each method, how the invariants in these data structures
//! are maintained (grep for "Post-invariant").
//!
//! Given these invariants, we argue why each optimization preserves execution
//! semantics below (grep for "Preserves execution semantics").

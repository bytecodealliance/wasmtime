//! Implementation of a vanilla ABI, shared between several machines. The
//! implementation here assumes that arguments will be passed in registers
//! first, then additional args on the stack; that the stack grows downward,
//! contains a standard frame (return address and frame pointer), and the
//! compiler is otherwise free to allocate space below that with its choice of
//! layout; and that the machine has some notion of caller- and callee-save
//! registers. Most modern machines, e.g. x86-64 and AArch64, should fit this
//! mold and thus both of these backends use this shared implementation.
//!
//! See the documentation in specific machine backends for the "instantiation"
//! of this generic ABI, i.e., which registers are caller/callee-save, arguments
//! and return values, and any other special requirements.
//!
//! For now the implementation here assumes a 64-bit machine, but we intend to
//! make this 32/64-bit-generic shortly.
//!
//! # Vanilla ABI
//!
//! First, arguments and return values are passed in registers up to a certain
//! fixed count, after which they overflow onto the stack. Multiple return
//! values either fit in registers, or are returned in a separate return-value
//! area on the stack, given by a hidden extra parameter.
//!
//! Note that the exact stack layout is up to us. We settled on the
//! below design based on several requirements. In particular, we need
//! to be able to generate instructions (or instruction sequences) to
//! access arguments, stack slots, and spill slots before we know how
//! many spill slots or clobber-saves there will be, because of our
//! pass structure. We also prefer positive offsets to negative
//! offsets because of an asymmetry in some machines' addressing modes
//! (e.g., on AArch64, positive offsets have a larger possible range
//! without a long-form sequence to synthesize an arbitrary
//! offset). We also need clobber-save registers to be "near" the
//! frame pointer: Windows unwind information requires it to be within
//! 240 bytes of RBP. Finally, it is not allowed to access memory
//! below the current SP value.
//!
//! We assume that a prologue first pushes the frame pointer (and
//! return address above that, if the machine does not do that in
//! hardware). We set FP to point to this two-word frame record. We
//! store all other frame slots below this two-word frame record, as
//! well as enough space for arguments to the largest possible
//! function call. The stack pointer then remains at this position
//! for the duration of the function, allowing us to address all
//! frame storage at positive offsets from SP.
//!
//! Note that if we ever support dynamic stack-space allocation (for
//! `alloca`), we will need a way to reference spill slots and stack
//! slots relative to a dynamic SP, because we will no longer be able
//! to know a static offset from SP to the slots at any particular
//! program point. Probably the best solution at that point will be to
//! revert to using the frame pointer as the reference for all slots,
//! to allow generating spill/reload and stackslot accesses before we
//! know how large the clobber-saves will be.
//!
//! # Stack Layout
//!
//! The stack looks like:
//!
//! ```plain
//!   (high address)
//!                              |          ...              |

//! Cost functions for egraph representation.

use crate::ir::Opcode;

/// A cost of computing some value in the program.
///
/// Costs are measured in an arbitrary union that we represent in a
/// `u32`. The ordering is meant to be meaningful, but the value of a
/// single unit is arbitrary (and "not to scale"). We use a collection
/// of heuristics to try to make this approximation at least usable.
///
/// We start by defining costs for each opcode (see `pure_op_cost`
/// below). The cost of computing some value, initially, is the cost
/// of its opcode, plus the cost of computing its inputs.
///
/// We then adjust the cost according to loop nests: for each
/// loop-nest level, we multiply by 1024. Because we only have 32
/// bits, we limit this scaling to a loop-level of two (i.e., multiply
/// by 2^20 ~= 1M).
///
/// Arithmetic on costs is always saturating: we don't want to wrap
/// around and return to a tiny cost when adding the costs of two very
/// expensive operations. It is better to approximate and lose some
/// precision than to lose the ordering by wrapping.
///
/// Finally, we reserve the highest value, `u32::MAX`, as a sentinel
/// that means "infinite". This is separate from the finite costs and
/// not reachable by doing arithmetic on them (even when overflowing)
/// -- we saturate just *below* infinity. (This is done by the
/// `finite()` method.) An infinite cost is used to represent a value
/// that cannot be computed, or otherwise serve as a sentinel when
/// performing search for the lowest-cost representation of a value.

//! Last-store tracking via alias analysis.
//!
//! We partition memory state into several *disjoint pieces* of
//! "abstract state". There are a finite number of such pieces:
//! currently, we call them "heap", "table", "vmctx", and "other". Any
//! given address in memory belongs to exactly one disjoint piece.
//!
//! One never tracks which piece a concrete address belongs to at
//! runtime; this is a purely static concept. Instead, all
//! memory-accessing instructions (loads and stores) are labeled with
//! one of these four categories in the `MemFlags`. It is forbidden
//! for a load or store to access memory under one category and a
//! later load or store to access the same memory under a different
//! category. This is ensured to be true by construction during
//! frontend translation into CLIF and during legalization.
//!
//! Given that this non-aliasing property is ensured by the producer
//! of CLIF, we can compute a *may-alias* property: one load or store
//! may-alias another load or store if both access the same category
//! of abstract state.
//!
//! The "last store" pass helps to compute this aliasing: we perform a
//! fixpoint analysis to track the last instruction that *might have*
//! written to a given part of abstract state. We also track the block
//! containing this store.
//!
//! We can't say for sure that the "last store" *did* actually write
//! that state, but we know for sure that no instruction *later* than
//! it (up to the current instruction) did. However, we can get a
//! must-alias property from this: if at a given load or store, we
//! look backward to the "last store", *AND* we find that it has
//! exactly the same address expression and value type, then we know
//! that the current instruction's access *must* be to the same memory
//! location.
//!
//! To get this must-alias property, we leverage the node
//! hashconsing. We design the Eq/Hash (node identity relation
//! definition) of the `Node` struct so that all loads with (i) the
//! same "last store", and (ii) the same address expression, and (iii)
//! the same opcode-and-offset, will deduplicate (the first will be
//! computed, and the later ones will use the same value). Furthermore
//! we have an optimization that rewrites a load into the stored value
//! of the last store *if* the last store has the same address
//! expression and constant offset.
//!
//! This gives us two optimizations, "redundant load elimination" and
//! "store-to-load forwarding".
//!
//! In theory we could also do *dead-store elimination*, where if a
//! store overwrites a value earlier written by another store, *and*
//! if no other load/store to the abstract state category occurred,
//! *and* no other trapping instruction occurred (at which point we
//! need an up-to-date memory state because post-trap-termination
//! memory state can be observed), *and* we can prove the original
//! store could not have trapped, then we can eliminate the original
//! store. Because this is so complex, and the conditions for doing it
//! correctly when post-trap state must be correct likely reduce the
//! potential benefit, we don't yet do this.

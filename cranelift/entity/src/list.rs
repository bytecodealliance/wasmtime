/// A small list of entity references allocated from a pool.
///
/// An `EntityList<T>` type provides similar functionality to `Vec<T>`, but with some important
/// differences in the implementation:
///
/// 1. Memory is allocated from a `ListPool<T>` instead of the global heap.
/// 2. The footprint of an entity list is 4 bytes, compared with the 24 bytes for `Vec<T>`.
/// 3. An entity list doesn't implement `Drop`, leaving it to the pool to manage memory.
///
/// The list pool is intended to be used as a LIFO allocator. After building up a larger data
/// structure with many list references, the whole thing can be discarded quickly by clearing the
/// pool.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// Entity lists are not as safe to use as `Vec<T>`, but they never jeopardize Rust's memory safety
/// guarantees. These are the problems to be aware of:
///
/// - If you lose track of an entity list, its memory won't be recycled until the pool is cleared.
///   This can cause the pool to grow very large with leaked lists.
/// - If entity lists are used after their pool is cleared, they may contain garbage data, and
///   modifying them may corrupt other lists in the pool.
/// - If an entity list is used with two different pool instances, both pools are likely to become
///   corrupted.
///
/// Entity lists can be cloned, but that operation should only be used as part of cloning the whole
/// function they belong to. *Cloning an entity list does not allocate new memory for the clone*.
/// It creates an alias of the same memory.
///
/// Entity lists cannot be hashed and compared for equality because it's not possible to compare the
/// contents of the list without the pool reference.
///
/// # Implementation
///
/// The `EntityList` itself is designed to have the smallest possible footprint. This is important
/// because it is used inside very compact data structures like `InstructionData`. The list
/// contains only a 32-bit index into the pool's memory vector, pointing to the first element of
/// the list.
///
/// The pool is just a single `Vec<T>` containing all of the allocated lists. Each list is
/// represented as three contiguous parts:
///
/// 1. The number of elements in the list.
/// 2. The list elements.
/// 3. Excess capacity elements.
///
/// The total size of the three parts is always a power of two, and the excess capacity is always
/// as small as possible. This means that shrinking a list may cause the excess capacity to shrink
/// if a smaller power-of-two size becomes available.
///
/// Both growing and shrinking a list may cause it to be reallocated in the pool vector.
///
/// The index stored in an `EntityList` points to part 2, the list elements. The value 0 is
/// reserved for the empty list which isn't allocated in the vector.

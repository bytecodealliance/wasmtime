/// Helper trait used to add `signed()` methods to primitive unsigned integer
/// types.

/// The purpose of this trait is to signal the intent that the sign bit of na
/// unsigned integer is intended to be discarded and the value is instead
/// understood to be a "bag of bits" where the conversion to a signed number
/// is intended to be lossless bit-wise. This can be used for example when
/// converting an unsigned integer into a signed integer for constrained reasons
/// outside the scope of the code in question.

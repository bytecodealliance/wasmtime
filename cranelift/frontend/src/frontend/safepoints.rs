/// A simple liveness analysis.

/// This analysis is used to determine which needs-stack-map values are live
/// across safepoint instructions.
///
/// This is a backwards analysis, from uses (which mark values live) to defs
/// (which remove values from the live set) and from successor blocks to
/// predecessor blocks.
///
/// We compute two live sets for each block:
///
/// 1. The live-in set, which is the set of values that are live when control
///    enters the block.
///
/// 2. The live-out set, which is the set of values that are live when control
///    exits the block.
///
/// A block's live-out set is the union of its successors' live-in sets
/// successors. A block's live-in set is the set of values that are still live
/// after the block's instructions have been processed.
///
/// ```text
/// live_in(block) = union(live_out(s) for s in successors(block))
/// live_out(block) = live_in(block) - defs(block) + uses(block)
/// ```
///
/// Whenever we update a block's live-in set, we must reprocess all of its
/// predecessors, because those predecessors' live-out sets depend on this
/// block's live-in set. Processing continues until the live sets stop changing
/// and we've reached a fixed-point. Each time we process a block, its live sets
/// can only grow monotonically, and therefore we know that the computation will
/// reach its fixed-point and terminate. This fixed-point is implemented with a
/// classic worklist algorithm.
///
/// The worklist is seeded such that we initially process blocks in post-order,
/// which ensures that, when we have a loop-free control-flow graph, we only
/// process each block once. We pop a block off the worklist for
/// processing. Whenever a block's live-in set is updated during processing, we
/// push its predecessors onto the worklist so that their live-in sets can be
/// updated. Once the worklist is empty, there are no more blocks needing
/// updates, and we've reached the fixed-point.
///
/// Note: For simplicity, we do not flow liveness from block parameters back to
/// branch arguments, and instead always consider branch arguments live.
///
/// Furthermore, we do not differentiate between uses of a needs-stack-map value
/// that ultimately flow into a side-effecting operation versus uses that
/// themselves are not live. This could be tightened up in the future, but we're
/// starting with the easiest, simplest thing. It also means that we do not need
/// `O(all values)` space, only `O(needs-stack-map values)`. Finally, none of
/// our mid-end optimization passes have run at this point in time yet, so there
/// probably isn't much, if any, dead code.
///
/// After we've computed the live-in and -out sets for each block, we pass once
/// more over each block, processing its instructions again. This time, we
/// record the precise set of needs-stack-map values that are live across each
/// safepoint instruction inside the block, which is the final output of this

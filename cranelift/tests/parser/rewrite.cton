; The .cton parser can't preserve the actual entity numbers in the input file
; since entities are numbered as they are created. For entities declared in the
; preamble, this is no problem, but for EBB and value references, mapping
; source numbers to real numbers can be a problem.
;
; It is possible to refer to instructions and EBBs that have not yet been
; defined in the lexical order, so the parser needs to rewrite these references
; after the fact.

; Check that defining numbers are rewritten.

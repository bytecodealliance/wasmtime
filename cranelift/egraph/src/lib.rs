//! # ægraph (aegraph, or acyclic e-graph) implementation.
//!
//! An aegraph is a form of e-graph. We will first describe the
//! e-graph, then the aegraph as a slightly less powerful but highly
//! optimized variant of it.
//!
//! The main goal of this library is to be explicitly memory-efficient
//! and light on allocations. We need to be as fast and as small as
//! possible in order to minimize impact on compile time in a
//! production compiler.
//!
//! ## The e-graph
//!
//! An e-graph, or equivalence graph, is a kind of node-based
//! intermediate representation (IR) data structure that consists of
//! *eclasses* and *enodes*. An eclass contains one or more enodes;
//! semantically an eclass is like a value, and an enode is one way to
//! compute that value. If several enodes are in one eclass, the data
//! structure is asserting that any of these enodes, if evaluated,
//! would produce the value.
//!
//! An e-graph also contains a deduplicating hash-map of nodes, so if
//! the user creates the same e-node more than once, they get the same
//! e-class ID.
//!
//! In the usual use-case, an e-graph is used to build a sea-of-nodes
//! IR for a function body or other expression-based code, and then
//! *rewrite rules* are applied to the e-graph. Each rewrite
//! potentially introduces a new e-node that is equivalent to an
//! existing e-node, and then unions the two e-nodes' classes
//! together.
//!
//! In the trivial case this results in an e-class containing a series
//! of e-nodes that are newly added -- all known forms of an
//! expression -- but Note how if a rewrite rule rewrites into an
//! existing e-node (discovered via deduplication), rewriting can
//! result in unioning of two e-classes that have existed for some
//! time.
//!
//! An e-graph's enodes refer to *classes* for their arguments, rather
//! than other nodes directly. This is key to the ability of an
//! e-graph to canonicalize: when two e-classes that are already used
//! as arguments by other e-nodes are unioned, all e-nodes that refer
//! to those e-classes are themselves re-canonicalized. This can
//! result in "cascading" unioning of eclasses, in a process that
//! discovers the transitive implications of all individual
//! equalities. This process is known as "equality saturation".
//!
//! ## The acyclic e-graph (aegraph)
//!
//! An e-graph is powerful, but it can also be expensive to build and
//! saturate: there are often many different forms an expression can
//! take (because many different rewrites are possible), and cascading
//! canonicalization requires heavyweight data structure bookkeeping
//! that is expensive to maintain.
//!
//! This crate introduces the aegraph: an acyclic e-graph. This data
//! structure stores an e-class as an *immutable persistent data
//! structure*. An id can refer to some *level* of an eclass: a
//! snapshot of the nodes in the eclass at one point in time. The
//! nodes referred to by this id never change, though the eclass may
//! grow later.
//!
//! A *union* is also an operation that creates a new eclass id: the
//! original eclass IDs refer to the original eclass contents, while
//! the id resulting from the `union()` operation refers to an eclass
//! that has all nodes.
//!
//! In order to allow for adequate canonicalization, an enode normally
//! stores the *latest* eclass id for each argument, but computes
//! hashes and equality using a *canonical* eclass id. We define such
//! a canonical id with a union-find data structure, just as for a
//! traditional e-graph. It is normally the lowest id referring to
//! part of the eclass.
//!
//! The persistent/immutable nature of this data structure yields one
//! extremely important property: it is acyclic! This simplifies
//! operation greatly:
//!
//! - When "elaborating" out of the e-graph back to linearized code,
//!   so that we can generate machine code, we do not need to break
//!   cycles. A given enode cannot indirectly refer back to itself.
//!
//! - When applying rewrite rules, the nodes visible from a given id
//!   for an eclass never change. This means that we only need to
//!   apply rewrite rules at that node id *once*.
//!
//! ## Data Structure and Example
//!
//! Each eclass id refers to a table entry ("eclass node", which is
//! different than an "enode") that can be one of:
//!
//! - A single enode;
//! - An enode and an earlier eclass id it is appended to (a "child"
//!   eclass node);
//! - A "union node" with two earlier eclass ids.
//!
//! Building the aegraph consists solely of adding new entries to the
//! end of this table of eclass nodes. An enode referenced from any
//! given eclass node can only refer to earlier eclass ids.
//!
//! For example, consider the following eclass table:
//!
//! ```plain
//!
//!    eclass/enode table
//!
//!     eclass1    iconst(1)
//!     eclass2    blockparam(block0, 0)
//!     eclass3    iadd(eclass1, eclass2)
//! ```
//!
//! This represents the expression `iadd(blockparam(block0, 0),
//! iconst(1))` (as the sole enode for eclass3).
//!
//! Now, say that as we further build the function body, we add
//! another enode `iadd(eclass3, iconst(1))`. The `iconst(1)` will be
//! deduplicated to `eclass1`, and the toplevel `iadd` will become its
//! own new eclass (`eclass4`).
//!
//! ```plain
//!     eclass4    iadd(eclass3, eclass1)
//! ```
//!
//! Now we apply our body of rewrite rules, and these results can
//! combine `x + 1 + 1` into `x + 2`; so we get:
//!
//! ```plain
//!     eclass5    iconst(2)
//!     eclass6    union(iadd(eclass2, eclass5), eclass4)
//! ```
//!
//! Note that we added the nodes for the new expression, and then we
//! union'd it with the earlier `eclass4`. Logically this represents a
//! single eclass that contains two nodes -- the `x + 1 + 1` and `x +
//! 2` representations -- and the *latest* id for the eclass,
//! `eclass6`, can reach all nodes in the eclass (here the node stored
//! in `eclass6` and the earlier one in `elcass4`).
//!
//! ## aegraph vs. egraph
//!
//! Where does an aegraph fall short of an e-graph -- or in other
//! words, why maintain the data structures to allow for full
//! (re)canonicalization at all, with e.g. parent pointers to
//! recursively update parents?
//!
//! This question deserves further study, but right now, it appears
//! that the difference is limited to a case like the following:
//!
//! - expression E1 is interned into the aegraph.
//! - expression E2 is interned into the aegraph. It uses E1 as an
//!   argument to one or more operators, and so refers to the
//!   (currently) latest id for E1.
//! - expression E3 is interned into the aegraph. A rewrite rule fires
//!   that unions E3 with E1.
//!
//! In an e-graph, the last action would trigger a re-canonicalization
//! of all "parents" (users) of E1; so E2 would be re-canonicalized
//! using an id that represents the union of E1 and E3. At
//! code-generation time, E2 could choose to use a value computed by
//! either E1's or E3's operator. In an aegraph, this is not the case:
//! E2's e-class and e-nodes are immutable once created, so E2 refers
//! only to E1's representation of the value (a "slice" of the whole
//! e-class).
//!
//! While at first this sounds quite limiting, there actually appears
//! to be a nice mutually-beneficial interaction with the immediate
//! application of rewrite rules: by applying all rewrites we know
//! about right when E1 is interned, E2 can refer to the best version
//! when it is created. The above scenario only leads to a missed
//! optimization if:
//!
//! - a rewrite rule exists from E3 to E1, but not E1 to E3; and
//! - E3 is *cheaper* than E1.
//!
//! Or in other words, this only matters if there is a rewrite rule
//! that rewrites into a more expensive direction. This is unlikely
//! for the sorts of rewrite rules we plan to write; it may matter
//! more if many possible equalities are expressed, such as
//! associativity, commutativity, etc.
//!
//! Note that the above represents the best of our understanding, but
//! there may be cases we have missed; a more complete examination of
//! this question would involve building a full equality saturation
//! loop on top of the (a)egraph in this crate, and testing with many
//! benchmarks to see if it makes any difference.
//!
//! ## Rewrite Rules (FLAX: Fast Localized Aegraph eXpansion)
//!
//! The most common use of an e-graph or aegraph is to serve as the IR
//! for a compiler. In this use-case, we usually wish to transform the
//! program using a body of rewrite rules that represent valid
//! transformations (equivalent and hopefully simpler ways of
//! computing results). An aegraph supports applying rules in a fairly
//! straightforward way: whenever a new eclass entry is added to the
//! table, we invoke a toplevel "apply all rewrite rules" entry
//! point. This entry point creates new nodes as needed, and when
//! done, unions the rewritten nodes with the original. We thus
//! *immediately* expand a new value into all of its representations.
//!
//! This immediate expansion stands in contrast to a traditional
//! "equality saturation" e-egraph system, in which it is usually best
//! to apply rules in batches and then fix up the
//! canonicalization. This approach was introduced in the `egg`
//! e-graph engine [^1]. We call our system FLAX (because flax is an
//! alternative to egg): Fast Localized Aegraph eXpansion.
//!
//! The reason that this is possible in an aegraph but not
//! (efficiently, at least) in a traditional e-graph is that the data
//! structure nodes are immutable once created: an eclass id will
//! always refer to a fixed set of enodes. There is no
//! recanonicalizing of eclass arguments as they union; but also this
//! is not usually necessary, because args will have already been
//! processed and eagerly rewritten as well. In other words, eager
//! rewriting and the immutable data structure mutually allow each
//! other to be practical; both work together.
//!

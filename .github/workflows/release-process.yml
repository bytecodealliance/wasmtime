# The purpose of this workflow is to orchestrate Wasmtime's release process as
# much as possible. This specific workflow is responsible for a few timed parts
# of the process:
#
# * On the 5th of every month a new release branch is automatically created and
#   the version number of the `main` branch is increased
# * On the 20th of every month the previous release branch is published.
#
# This automation is all done through PRs except for the creation of the release
# branch itself which is an write-action performed by this script. Otherwise
# humans are ideally reviewing and rubber-stamping the output of the script all
# other steps of the way.
#
# Note that this script also helps manage patch releases by sending a PR to the
# release branch with a bumped version number for all crates with a patch-bump.

          This is an [automated pull request][process] from CI which indicates that the next [\`release-$cur\` branch][branch] has been created and the \`main\` branch is getting its version number bumped from $cur to $num.

          Maintainers should take a moment to review the [release notes][RELEASES.md] for $cur and any updates should be made directly to the [release branch][branch].

          Another automated PR will be made in roughly 2 weeks time when for the actual release itself.

          If any issues arise on the \`main\` branch before the release is made then the issue should first be fixed on \`main\` and then backport to the \`release-$cur\` branch.

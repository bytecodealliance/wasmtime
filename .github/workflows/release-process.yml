# The purpose of this workflow is to, once a month, trigger Wasmtime's release
# process. All that actually happens here is that whenever this is triggered it
# will send a PR to the main repository with the version numbers automatically
# bumped. The next stage of the process is to simply merge the PR, and the
# `push-tag.yml` process takes over from there.
#
# Note that this creates a commit and a PR with a personal access token to
# ensure that the PR gets CI triggered on it. Additionally the commit message
# is specifically worded to get recognized by `push-tag.yml`.

          This is an [automated pull request][process] from CI which indicates

          the \`main\` branch is getting its version number bumped from $cur to
          $num.

          Maintainers should take a moment to review the [release
          notes][RELEASES.md] for $cur, and if any changes are necessary send
          PRs to the \`main\` branch to update [RELEASES.md] and then backport
          these PRs to the [release branch][branch].

          Another automated PR will be made in roughly 2 weeks time when for
          the actual release itself.

          If any issues arise on the \`main\` branch before the release is made
          then the issue should first be fixed on \`main\` and then backported
          to the \`release-$cur\` branch.

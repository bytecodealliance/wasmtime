## Installation

The Wasmtime CLI can be installed on Linux and macOS (locally) with a small install
script:

```sh
curl https://wasmtime.dev/install.sh -sSf | bash
```
This script installs into `$WASMTIME_HOME` (defaults to `$HOME/.wasmtime`), and executable is placed in `$WASMTIME_HOME/bin`.

Windows or otherwise interested users can download installers and
binaries directly from the [GitHub
Releases](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases) page.

## Example

If you've got the [Rust compiler
installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) then you can take some Rust
source code:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

and compile/run it with:

```sh
$ rustup target add wasm32-wasip1
$ rustc hello.rs --target wasm32-wasip1
$ wasmtime hello.wasm
Hello, world!
```

(Note: make sure you installed Rust using the `rustup` method in the official
instructions above, and do not have a copy of the Rust toolchain installed on
your system in some other way as well (e.g. the system package manager). Otherwise, the `rustup target add...`
command may not install the target for the correct copy of Rust.)

## Features

* **Fast**. Wasmtime is built on the optimizing [Cranelift] code generator to
  quickly generate high-quality machine code either at runtime or
  ahead-of-time. Wasmtime is optimized for efficient instantiation, low-overhead
  calls between the embedder and wasm, and scalability of concurrent instances.

* **[Secure]**. Wasmtime's development is strongly focused on correctness and
  security. Building on top of Rust's runtime safety guarantees, each Wasmtime
  feature goes through careful review and consideration via an [RFC
  process]. Once features are designed and implemented, they undergo 24/7
  fuzzing donated by [Google's OSS Fuzz]. As features stabilize they become part
  of a [release][release policy], and when things go wrong we have a
  well-defined [security policy] in place to quickly mitigate and patch any
  issues. We follow best practices for defense-in-depth and integrate
  protections and mitigations for issues like Spectre. Finally, we're working to
  push the state-of-the-art by collaborating with academic researchers to
  formally verify critical parts of Wasmtime and Cranelift.

* **[Configurable]**. Wasmtime uses sensible defaults, but can also be
  configured to provide more fine-grained control over things like CPU and
  memory consumption. Whether you want to run Wasmtime in a tiny environment or
  on massive servers with many concurrent instances, we've got you covered.

* **[WASI]**. Wasmtime supports a rich set of APIs for interacting with the host
  environment through the [WASI standard](https://wasi.dev).

* **[Standards Compliant]**. Wasmtime passes the [official WebAssembly test
  suite](https://github.com/WebAssembly/testsuite), implements the [official C
  API of wasm](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasm-c-api), and implements
  [future proposals to WebAssembly](https://github.com/WebAssembly/proposals) as
  well. Wasmtime developers are intimately engaged with the WebAssembly
  standards process all along the way too.

//! Generation of the throw-stub.
//!
//! In order to throw exceptions from within Cranelift-compiled code,
//! we provide a runtime function helper meant to be called by host
//! code that is invoked by guest code.
//!
//! The helper below must be provided a delimited range on the stack
//! corresponding to Cranelift frames above the current host code. It
//! will look for any handlers in this code, given a closure that
//! knows how to use an absolute PC to look up a module's exception
//! table and its start-of-code-segment. If a handler is found, the
//! helper below will return the SP, FP and PC that must be
//! restored. Architecture-specific helpers are provided to jump to
//! this new context with payload values. Otherwise, if no handler is
//! found, the return type indicates this, and it is the caller's
//! responsibility to invoke alternative behavior (e.g., abort the
//! program or unwind all the way to initial Cranelift-code entry).

//! Stack-walking of a Wasm stack.
//!
//! A stack walk requires a first and last frame pointer (FP), and it
//! only works on code that has been compiled with frame pointers
//! enabled (`preserve_frame_pointers` Cranelift option enabled). The
//! stack walk follows the singly-linked list of saved frame pointer
//! and return address pairs on the stack that is naturally built by
//! function prologues.
//!
//! This crate makes use of the fact that Wasmtime surrounds Wasm
//! frames by trampolines both at entry and exit, and is "up the
//! stack" from the point doing the unwinding: in other words, host
//! code invokes Wasm code via an entry trampoline, that code may call
//! other Wasm code, and ultimately it calls back to host code via an
//! exit trampoline. That exit trampoline is able to provide the
//! "start FP" (FP at exit trampoline) and "end FP" (FP at entry
//! trampoline) and this stack-walker can visit all Wasm frames
//! active on the stack between those two.
//!
//! This module provides a visitor interface to frames, but is
//! agnostic to the desired use-case or consumer of the frames, and to
//! the overall runtime structure.

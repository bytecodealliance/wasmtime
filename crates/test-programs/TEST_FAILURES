TODOs:
* File::reopen_with_fdflags is unimplemented, File::get_fdflags is lying - these are
  fcntl on unix, reopenfile / require reopening on windows.


# Linux

* path_rename_trailing_slashes
    - trailing slash behavior of files is wrong: trailing slashes are ignored,
      should cause an error.
* remove_directory_trailing_slashes
    - cap-std Dir::remove_dir gives EINVAL when trying to remove dir with
      trailing slash. otherwise, everything passes.

* fd_flags_set
    - set_fdflags is not implemented. test wanted to clear O_APPEND mode
* path_filestat
    - fdstat.fs_flags is not populated correctly - APPEND | SYNC aren't
      present because File::get_fdflags isnt implemented correctly


# Windows

* fd_readdir
    - DirEntry metadata ino panics on windows: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cap-std/issues/142
* file_allocate
    - call to fd_allocate(10,10) reduces size from 100 to 20
    - fix upstream: fd_allocate is impossible on windows, so dont even try
* nofollow_errors
    - I loosened up some errno acceptance but windows requires rmdir to delete
      a symlink to a directory, rather than unlink_file
* symlink_create
    - narrowed down the symlink delete issue that only shows up on linux
* path_rename
    - permission denied on windows to rename a dir to an existing empty dir
        - This should fail
        - We should disable this test on windows
    - is there a windows api that makes this possible?
    - if not, and we drew the line at "no racy emulation" in fallocate, then
      is returning the error windows gives us OK here?

* path_link
    - fails on the first dangling symlink

## "Trailing slashes are a bonified boondoggle" - Dan

* interesting_paths
    - on windows, opening a directory with a trailing slash fails.
* path_rename_trailing_slashes
* path_symlink_trailing_slashes
* remove_directory_trailing_slashes
* unlink_file_trailing_slashes

## Same missing functionality as over in Linux:

* fd_flags_set
* path_filestat

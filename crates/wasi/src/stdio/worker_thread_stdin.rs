//! Handling for standard in using a worker task.
//!
//! Standard input is a global singleton resource for the entire program which
//! needs special care. Currently this implementation adheres to a few
//! constraints which make this nontrivial to implement.
//!
//! * Any number of guest wasm programs can read stdin. While this doesn't make
//!   a ton of sense semantically they shouldn't block forever. Instead it's a
//!   race to see who actually reads which parts of stdin.
//!
//! * Data from stdin isn't actually read unless requested. This is done to try
//!   to be a good neighbor to others running in the process. Under the
//!   assumption that most programs have one "thing" which reads stdin the
//!   actual consumption of bytes is delayed until the wasm guest is dynamically
//!   chosen to be that "thing". Before that data from stdin is not consumed to
//!   avoid taking it from other components in the process.
//!
//! * Tokio's documentation indicates that "interactive stdin" is best done with
//!   a helper thread to avoid blocking shutdown of the event loop. That's
//!   respected here where all stdin reading happens on a blocking helper thread
//!   that, at this time, is never shut down.
//!
//! This module is one that's likely to change over time though as new systems
//! are encountered along with preexisting bugs.

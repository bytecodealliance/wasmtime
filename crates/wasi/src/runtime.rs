//! This module provides an "ambient Tokio runtime"
//! [`with_ambient_tokio_runtime`]. Embedders of wasmtime-wasi may do so from
//! synchronous Rust, and not use tokio directly. The implementation of
//! wasmtime-wasi requires a tokio executor in a way that is [deeply tied to
//! its
//! design](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/7973#issuecomment-1960513214).
//! When used from a sychrnonous wasmtime context, this module provides the
//! wrapper function [`in_tokio`] used throughout the shim implementations of
//! synchronous component binding `Host` traits in terms of the async ones.
//!
//! This module also provides a thin wrapper on tokio's tasks.
//! [`AbortOnDropJoinHandle`], which is exactly like a
//! [`tokio::task::JoinHandle`] except for the obvious behavioral change. This
//! whole crate, and any child crates which spawn tasks as part of their
//! implementations, should please use this crate's [`spawn`] and
//! [`spawn_blocking`] over tokio's. so we wanted the type name to stick out
//! if someone misses it.
//!
//! Each of these facilities should be used by dependencies of wasmtime-wasi
//! which when implementing component bindings.

        // The `yield_now` here is non-obvious and if you're reading this
        // you're likely curious about why it's here. This is currently required
        // to get some features of "sync mode" working correctly, such as with
        // the CLI. To illustrate why this is required, consider a program
        // organized as:
        //
        // * A program has a `pollable` that it's waiting on.
        // * This `pollable` is always ready .
        // * Actually making the corresponding operation ready, however,
        //   requires some background work on Tokio's part.
        // * The program is looping on "wait for readiness" coupled with
        //   performing the operation.
        //
        // In this situation this program ends up infinitely looping in waiting
        // for pollables. The reason appears to be that when we enter the tokio
        // runtime here it doesn't necessary yield to background work because
        // the provided future `f` is ready immediately. The future `f` will run
        // through the list of pollables and determine one of them is ready.
        //
        // Historically this happened with UDP sockets. A test send a datagram
        // from one socket to another and the other socket infinitely didn't
        // receive the data. This appeared to be because the server socket was
        // waiting on `READABLE | WRITABLE` (which is itself a bug but ignore
        // that) and the socket was currently in the "writable" state but never
        // ended up receiving a notification for the "readable" state. Moving
        // the socket to "readable" would require Tokio to perform some
        // background work via epoll/kqueue/handle events but if the future
        // provided here is always ready, then that never happened.
        //
        // Thus the `yield_now()` is an attempt to force Tokio to go do some
        // background work eventually and look at new interest masks for
        // example. This is a bit of a kludge but everything's already a bit
        // wonky in synchronous mode anyway. Note that this is hypothesized to
        // not be an issue in async mode because async mode typically has the
        // Tokio runtime in a separate thread or otherwise participating in a
        // larger application, it's only here in synchronous mode where we
        // effectively own the runtime that we need some special care.

The `wasi-common` crate will ultimately serve as a library providing a common implementation of
WASI hostcalls for reuse in any WASI (and potentially non-WASI) runtimes
such as [Wasmtime] and [Lucet].

The library is an adaption of [lucet-wasi] crate from the [Lucet] project, and it is
currently based on [40ae1df][lucet-wasi-tracker] git revision.

Please note that the library requires Rust compiler version at least 1.37.0.

## Supported syscalls

### *nix
In our *nix implementation, we currently support the entire [WASI API]
with the exception of the `proc_raise` hostcall, as it is expected to
be dropped entirely from WASI.

[WASI API]: https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/master/phases/snapshot/docs.md

### Windows
In our Windows implementation, we currently support the minimal subset of [WASI API]
which allows for running the very basic "Hello world!" style WASM apps. More coming shortly,
so stay tuned!

## Development hints
When testing the crate, you may want to enable and run full wasm32 integration testsuite. This
requires `wasm32-wasip1` target installed which can be done as follows using [rustup]

```
rustup target add wasm32-wasip1
```

[rustup]: https://rustup.rs

Now, you should be able to run the integration testsuite by running `cargo test` on the
`test-programs` package with `test-programs/test_programs` feature enabled:

```
cargo test --features test-programs/test_programs --package test-programs
```

        // * The lifetime of the returned pointer is connected to the lifetime
        //   of `self`. This reflects how when `self` is destroyed the `data` is
        //   destroyed as well, or otherwise the returned slice will be valid
        //   for as long as `self` is valid since `self` owns the original data
        //   at that point.
        //
        // * This function was given ownership of `data` so it should be safe to
        //   hand back a mutable reference. Once placed within a `ScopeVec` the
        //   data is never mutated so the caller will enjoy exclusive access to
        //   the slice of the original vec.
        //

        // all of `data` after the data has been pushed onto our internal list.

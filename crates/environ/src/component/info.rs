// General runtime type-information about a component.
//
// Compared to the `Module` structure for core wasm this type is pretty
// significantly different. The core wasm `Module` corresponds roughly 1-to-1
// with the structure of the wasm module itself, but instead a `Component` is
// more of a "compiled" representation where the original structure is thrown
// away in favor of a more optimized representation. The considerations for this
// are:
//
// * This representation of a `Component` avoids the need to create a
//   `PrimaryMap` of some form for each of the index spaces within a component.
//   This is less so an issue about allocations and more so that this information
//   generally just isn't needed any time after instantiation. Avoiding creating
//   these altogether helps components be lighter weight at runtime and
//   additionally accelerates instantiation.
//
// * Components can have arbitrary nesting and internally do instantiations via
//   string-based matching. At instantiation-time, though, we want to do as few
//   string-lookups in hash maps as much as we can since they're significantly
//   slower than index-based lookups. Furthermore while the imports of a
//   component are not statically known the rest of the structure of the
//   component is statically known which enables the ability to track precisely
//   what matches up where and do all the string lookups at compile time instead
//   of instantiation time.
//
// * Finally by performing this sort of dataflow analysis we are capable of
//   identifying what adapters need trampolines for compilation or fusion. For
//   example this tracks when host functions are lowered which enables us to
//   enumerate what trampolines are required to enter into a component.
//   Additionally (eventually) this will track all of the "fused" adapter
//   functions where a function from one component instance is lifted and then
//   lowered into another component instance. Altogether this enables Wasmtime's
//   AOT-compilation where the artifact from compilation is suitable for use in
//   running the component without the support of a compiler at runtime.
//
// Note, however, that the current design of `Component` has fundamental
// limitations which it was not designed for. For example there is no feasible
// way to implement either importing or exporting a component itself from the
// root component. Currently we rely on the ability to have static knowledge of
// what's coming from the host which at this point can only be either functions
// or core wasm modules. Additionally one flat list of initializers for a
// component are produced instead of initializers-per-component which would
// otherwise be required to export a component from a component.
//
// For now this tradeoff is made as it aligns well with the intended use case
// for components in an embedding. This may need to be revisited though if the
// requirements of embeddings change over time.

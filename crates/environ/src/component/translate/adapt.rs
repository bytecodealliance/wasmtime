//! Identification and creation of fused adapter modules in Wasmtime.
//!
//! A major piece of the component model is the ability for core wasm modules to
//! talk to each other through the use of lifted and lowered functions. For
//! example one core wasm module can export a function which is lifted. Another
//! component could import that lifted function, lower it, and pass it as the
//! import to another core wasm module. This is what Wasmtime calls "adapter
//! fusion" where two core wasm functions are coming together through the
//! component model.
//!
//! There are a few ingredients during adapter fusion:
//!
//! * A core wasm function which is "lifted".
//! * A "lift type" which is the type that the component model function had in
//!   the original component
//! * A "lower type" which is the type that the component model function has
//!   in the destination component (the one the uses `canon lower`)
//! * Configuration options for both the lift and the lower operations such as
//!   memories, reallocs, etc.
//!
//! With these ingredients combined Wasmtime must produce a function which
//! connects the two components through the options specified. The fused adapter
//! performs tasks such as validation of passed values, copying data between
//! linear memories, etc.
//!
//! Wasmtime's current implementation of fused adapters is designed to reduce
//! complexity elsewhere as much as possible while also being suitable for being
//! used as a polyfill for the component model in JS environments as well. To
//! that end Wasmtime implements a fused adapter with another wasm module that
//! it itself generates on the fly. The usage of WebAssembly for fused adapters
//! has a number of advantages:
//!
//! * There is no need to create a raw Cranelift-based compiler. This is where
//!   majority of "unsafety" lives in Wasmtime so reducing the need to lean on
//!   this or audit another compiler is predicted to weed out a whole class of
//!   bugs in the fused adapter compiler.
//!
//! * As mentioned above generation of WebAssembly modules means that this is
//!   suitable for use in JS environments. For example a hypothetical tool which
//!   polyfills a component onto the web today would need to do something for
//!   adapter modules, and ideally the adapters themselves are speedy. While
//!   this could all be written in JS the adapting process is quite nontrivial
//!   so sharing code with Wasmtime would be ideal.
//!
//! * Using WebAssembly insulates the implementation to bugs to a certain
//!   degree. While logic bugs are still possible it should be much more
//!   difficult to have segfaults or things like that. With adapters exclusively
//!   executing inside a WebAssembly sandbox like everything else the failure
//!   modes to the host at least should be minimized.
//!
//! * Integration into the runtime is relatively simple, the adapter modules are
//!   just another kind of wasm module to instantiate and wire up at runtime.
//!   The goal is that the `GlobalInitializer` list that is processed at runtime
//!   will have all of its `Adapter`-using variants erased by the time it makes
//!   its way all the way up to Wasmtime. This means that the support in
//!   Wasmtime prior to adapter modules is actually the same as the support
//!   after adapter modules are added, keeping the runtime fiddly bits quite
//!   minimal.
//!
//! This isn't to say that this approach isn't without its disadvantages of
//! course. For now though this seems to be a reasonable set of tradeoffs for
//! the development stage of the component model proposal.
//!
//! ## Creating adapter modules
//!
//! With WebAssembly itself being used to implement fused adapters, Wasmtime
//! still has the question of how to organize the adapter functions into actual
//! wasm modules.
//!
//! The first thing you might reach for is to put all the adapters into the same
//! wasm module. This cannot be done, however, because some adapters may depend
//! on other adapters (transitively) to be created. This means that if
//! everything were in the same module there would be no way to instantiate the
//! module. An example of this dependency is an adapter (A) used to create a
//! core wasm instance (M) whose exported memory is then referenced by another
//! adapter (B). In this situation the adapter B cannot be in the same module
//! as adapter A because B needs the memory of M but M is created with A which
//! would otherwise create a circular dependency.
//!
//! The second possibility of organizing adapter modules would be to place each
//! fused adapter into its own module. Each `canon lower` would effectively
//! become a core wasm module instantiation at that point. While this works it's
//! currently believed to be a bit too fine-grained. For example it would mean
//! that importing a dozen lowered functions into a module could possibly result
//! in up to a dozen different adapter modules. While this possibility could
//! work it has been ruled out as "probably too expensive at runtime".
//!
//! Thus the purpose and existence of this module is now evident -- this module
//! exists to identify what exactly goes into which adapter module. This will
//! evaluate the `GlobalInitializer` lists coming out of the `inline` pass and
//! insert `InstantiateModule` entries for where adapter modules should be
//! created.
//!
//! ## Partitioning adapter modules
//!
//! Currently this module does not attempt to be really all that fancy about
//! grouping adapters into adapter modules. The main idea is that most items
//! within an adapter module are likely to be close together since they're
//! theoretically going to be used for an instantiation of a core wasm module
//! just after the fused adapter was declared. With that in mind the current
//! algorithm is a one-pass approach to partitioning everything into adapter
//! modules.
//!
//! Adapters were identified in-order as part of the inlining phase of
//! translation where we're guaranteed that once an adapter is identified
//! it can't depend on anything identified later. The pass implemented here is
//! to visit all transitive dependencies of an adapter. If one of the
//! dependencies of an adapter is an adapter in the current adapter module
//! being built then the current module is finished and a new adapter module is
//! started. This should quickly partition adapters into contiugous chunks of
//! their index space which can be in adapter modules together.
//!
//! There's probably more general algorithms for this but for now this should be
//! fast enough as it's "just" a linear pass. As we get more components over
//! time this may want to be revisited if too many adapter modules are being
//! created.

//! Implementation of "inlining" a component into a flat list of initializers.
//!
//! After the first phase of compiling a component we're left with a single
//! root `Translation` for the original component along with a "static" list of
//! child components. Each `Translation` has a list of `LocalInitializer` items
//! inside of it which is a primitive representation of how the component
//! should be constructed with effectively one initializer per item in the
//! index space of a component. This "local initializer" list would be
//! relatively inefficient to process at runtime and more importantly doesn't
//! convey enough information to understand what trampolines need to be
//! compiled or what fused adapters need to be generated. This consequently is
//! the motivation for this file.
//!
//! The second phase of compilation, inlining here, will in a sense interpret
//! the initializers, at compile time, into a new list of `GlobalInitializer` entries
//! which are a sort of "global initializer". The generated `GlobalInitializer` is
//! much more specific than the `LocalInitializer` and additionally far fewer
//! `GlobalInitializer` structures are generated (in theory) than there are local
//! initializers.
//!
//! The "inlining" portion of the name of this module indicates how the
//! instantiation of a component is interpreted as calling a function. The
//! function's arguments are the imports provided to the instantiation of a
//! component, and further nested function calls happen on a stack when a
//! nested component is instantiated. The inlining then refers to how this
//! stack of instantiations is flattened to one list of `GlobalInitializer`
//! entries to represent the process of instantiating a component graph,
//! similar to how function inlining removes call instructions and creates one
//! giant function for a call graph. Here there are no inlining heuristics or
//! anything like that, we simply inline everything into the root component's
//! list of initializers.
//!
//! Another primary task this module performs is a form of dataflow analysis
//! to represent items in each index space with their definition rather than
//! references of relative indices. These definitions (all the `*Def` types in
//! this module) are not local to any one nested component and instead
//! represent state available at runtime tracked in the final `Component`
//! produced.
//!
//! With all this pieced together the general idea is relatively
//! straightforward. All of a component's initializers are processed in sequence
//! where instantiating a nested component pushes a "frame" onto a stack to
//! start executing and we resume at the old one when we're done. Items are
//! tracked where they come from and at the end after processing only the
//! side-effectful initializers are emitted to the `GlobalInitializer` list in the
//! final `Component`.

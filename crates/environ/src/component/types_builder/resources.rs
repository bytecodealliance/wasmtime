//! Implementation of resource type information within Wasmtime.
//!
//! Resource types are one of the trickier parts of the component model. Types
//! such as `list`, `record`, and `string` are considered "structural" where two
//! types are considered equal if their components are equal. For example `(list
//! $a)` and `(list $b)` are the same if `$a` and `$b` are the same. Resources,
//! however, are not as simple.
//!
//! The type of a resource can "change" sort of depending on who you are and how
//! you view it. Some examples of resources are:
//!
//! * When a resource is imported into a component the internal component
//!   doesn't know the underlying resource type, but the outer component which
//!   performed an instantiation knows that. This means that if a component
//!   imports two unique resources but is instantiated with two copies of the
//!   same resource the internal component can't know they're the same but the
//!   outer component knows they're the same.
//!
//! * Each instantiation of a component produces new resource types. This means
//!   that if a component instantiates a subcomponent twice then the resources
//!   defined in that subcomponent are considered different between the two
//!   instances.
//!
//! All this is basically to say that resources require special care. The
//! purpose of resources are to provide isolation across component boundaries
//! and strict guarantees around ownership and borrowing. Getting the type
//! information wrong can compromise on all of these guarantees which is
//! something Wasmtime would ideally avoid.
//!
//! ## Interaction with `wasmparser`
//!
//! The trickiness of resource types is not unique of Wasmtime and the first
//! line of translating a component, `wasmparser`, already has quite a lot of
//! support for handling all the various special cases of resources. Namely
//! `wasmparser` has a `ResourceId` type which can be used to test whether two
//! resources are the same or unique. For example in the above scenario where a
//! component imports two resources then within that component they'll have
//! unique ids. Externally though the outer component will be able to see that
//! the ids are the same.
//!
//! Given the subtlety here the goal is to lean on `wasmparser` as much as
//! possible for this information. The thinking is "well it got things right so
//! let's not duplicate". This is one of the motivations for plumbing
//! `wasmparser`'s type information throughout `LocalInitializer` structures
//! during translation of a component. During conversion to a
//! `GlobalInitializer` is where everything is boiled away.
//!
//! ## Converting to Wasmtime
//!
//! The purpose of this module then is to convert `wasmparser`'s view of
//! resources into Wasmtime's view of resources. Wasmtime's goal is to
//! determine how many tables are required for each resource within a component
//! and then from then on purely talk about table indices. Each component
//! instance will require a table per-resource and this figures that all out.
//!
//! The conversion process, however, is relatively tightly intertwined with type
//! conversion in general. The "leaves" of a type may be resources but there are
//! other structures in a type such as lists, records, variants, etc. This means
//! that the `ResourcesBuilder` below is embedded within a
//! `ComponentTypesBuilder`. This also means that it's unfortunately not easy to
//! disentangle pieces and have one nice standalone file that handles everything
//! related to type information about resources. Instead this one file was
//! chosen as the place for this doc comment but the file itself is deceptively
//! small as much of the other handling happens elsewhere in component
//! translation.
//!
//! For more details on fiddly bits see the documentation on various fields and
//! methods below.

/// Wasmtime's `TypeResourceTableIndex` type.
///
/// This is contained in a `ComponentTypesBuilder` but is modified quite a bit
/// manually via the `inline` phase of component instantiation.
///
/// This type crucially implements the `Clone` trait which is used to "snapshot"
/// the current state of resource translation. The purpose of `Clone` here is to
/// record translation information just before a subcomponent is instantiated to
/// restore it after the subcomponent's instantiation has completed. This is
/// done to handle instantiations of the same component multiple times
/// correctly.
///
/// Wasmparser produces one set of type information for a component, and not a
/// unique set of type information about its internals for each instantiation.
/// Each instance which results from instantiation gets a new type, but when
/// we're translating the instantiation of a component Wasmtime will re-run all
/// initializers. This means that if naively implemented the `ResourceId`
/// mapping from the first instantiation will be reused by the second
/// instantiation. The snapshotting behavior and restoration guarantees that
/// whenever a subcomponent is visited and instantiated it's guaranteed that
/// there's no registered information for its `ResourceId` definitions within
/// this builder.
///
/// Note that `ResourceId` references are guaranteed to be "local" in the sense
/// that if a resource is defined within a component then the ID it's assigned
/// internally within a component is different than the ID when it's
/// instantiated (since all instantiations produce new types). This means that
/// when throwing away state built-up from within a component that's also
/// reasonable because the information should never be used after a component is
/// left anyway.

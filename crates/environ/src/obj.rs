/// A custom Wasmtime-specific section of our compilation image which stores

/// This section has a custom binary encoding. Currently its encoding is:
///
/// * The section starts with a 32-bit little-endian integer. This integer is
///   how many entries are in the following two arrays.
/// * Next is an array with the previous count number of 32-bit little-endian
///   integers. This array is a sorted list of relative offsets within the text
///   section. This is intended to be a lookup array to perform a binary search
///   on an offset within the text section on this array.
/// * Finally there is another array, with the same count as before, also of
///   32-bit little-endian integers. These integers map 1:1 with the previous
///   array of offsets, and correspond to what the original offset was in the
///   wasm file.
///
/// Decoding this section is intentionally simple, it only requires loading a
/// 32-bit little-endian integer plus some bounds checks. Reading this section
/// is done with the `lookup_file_pos` function below. Reading involves
/// performing a binary search on the first array using the index found for the
/// native code offset to index into the second array and find the wasm code
/// offset.
///
/// At this time this section has an alignment of 1, which means all reads of it
/// are unaligned. Additionally at this time the 32-bit encodings chosen here
/// mean that >=4gb text sections are not supported.

/// This section is used at runtime to determine what flavor of trap happened to
/// ensure that embedders and debuggers know the reason for the wasm trap. The
/// encoding of this section is custom to Wasmtime and managed with helpers in
/// the `object` crate:
///
/// * First the section has a 32-bit little endian integer indicating how many
///   trap entries are in the section.
/// * Next is an array, of the same length as read before, of 32-bit
///   little-endian integers. These integers are offsets into the text section
///   of the compilation image.
/// * Finally is the same count number of bytes. Each of these bytes corresponds
///   to a trap code.
///
/// This section is decoded by `lookup_trap_code` below which will read the
/// section count, slice some bytes to get the various arrays, and then perform
/// a binary search on the offsets array to find the index corresponding to
/// the pc being looked up. If found the same index in the trap array (the array
/// of bytes) is the trap code for that offset.

/// to the 32-bit encodings for offsets this doesn't support images >=4gb.

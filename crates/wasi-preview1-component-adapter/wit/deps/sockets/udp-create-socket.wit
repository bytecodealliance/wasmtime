default interface udp-create-socket {
	use pkg.network.{network, error-code, ip-address-family}
	use pkg.udp.{udp-socket}

	/// Create a new UDP socket.
	/// 
	/// Similar to `socket(AF_INET or AF_INET6, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_UDP)` in POSIX.
	/// 
	/// This function does not require a network capability handle. This is considered to be safe because
	/// at time of creation, the socket is not bound to any `network` yet. Up to the moment `bind`/`connect` is called,
	/// the socket is effectively an in-memory configuration object, unable to communicate with the outside world.
	/// 
	/// All sockets are non-blocking. Use the wasi-poll interface to block on asynchronous operations.
	/// 
	/// # Typical errors
	/// - `not-supported`:                The host does not support UDP sockets. (EOPNOTSUPP)
	/// - `address-family-not-supported`: The specified `address-family` is not supported. (EAFNOSUPPORT)
	/// - `new-socket-limit`:             The new socket resource could not be created because of a system limit. (EMFILE, ENFILE)

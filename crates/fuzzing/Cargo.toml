# We rely on precompiled v8 binaries, but rusty-v8 doesn't have a precompiled
# binary for MinGW which is built on our CI. It does have one for Windows-msvc,
# though, so we could use that if we wanted. For now though just simplify a bit
# and don't depend on this on Windows.  The same applies on s390x.

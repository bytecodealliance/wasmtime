[features]
# Most modern CPUs are SMP (multicore). However, when only one core is present,
# some aspects of coherence are much cheaper. For example, RISC-V can use
# one instruction `fence.i` rather than a syscall that invokes all other cores.
# This feature enables such optimizations, but the resulting program will *only*
# be safe to run on one-core systems.

//! Interface to compiling GC-related things.
//!
//! This module and its interface are implemented twice: once when the `gc`
//! cargo feature is enabled and once when the feature is disabled. The goal is
//! to have just a single `cfg(feature = "gc")` for the whole crate, which
//! selects between these two implementations.

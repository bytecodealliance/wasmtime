# An on-by-default feature enabling runtime compilation of WebAssembly modules
# with the Cranelift compiler. Cranelift is the default compilation backend of
# Wasmtime. If disabled then WebAssembly modules can only be created from
# precompiled WebAssembly modules.
cranelift = ["wasmtime-cranelift"]

# Enables support for the `perf` jitdump profiler
jitdump = ["wasmtime-jit/jitdump"]

# Enables support for the `VTune` profiler
vtune = ["wasmtime-jit/vtune"]

# Enables parallel compilation of WebAssembly code.
parallel-compilation = ["rayon"]

# Enables support for automatic cache configuration to be enabled in `Config`.
cache = ["wasmtime-cache"]

# Enables support for "async stores" as well as defining host functions as
# `async fn` and calling functions asynchronously.
async = ["wasmtime-fiber", "wasmtime-runtime/async", "async-trait"]

# Enables support for the pooling instance allocation strategy
pooling-allocator = ["wasmtime-runtime/pooling-allocator"]

# Enables support for all architectures in Cranelift, allowing
# cross-compilation using the `wasmtime` crate's API, notably the
# `Engine::precompile_module` function.
all-arch = ["wasmtime-cranelift/all-arch"]

# Enables trap handling using POSIX signals instead of Mach exceptions on MacOS.
# It is useful for applications that do not bind their own exception ports and
# need portable signal handling.
posix-signals-on-macos = ["wasmtime-runtime/posix-signals-on-macos"]

# Enables, on supported platforms, the usage of copy-on-write initialization of
# compatible linear memories. For more information see the documentation of
# `Config::memory_init_cow`.
#
# Enabling this feature has no effect on unsupported platforms.

# Enables runtime support necessary to capture backtraces of WebAssembly code
# that is running.

# An on-by-default feature enabling runtime compilation of WebAssembly modules
# with the Cranelift compiler. Cranelift is the default compilation backend of
# Wasmtime. If disabled then WebAssembly modules can only be created from
# precompiled WebAssembly modules.
cranelift = ["wasmtime-cranelift"]

# Deprecated, does not actually do anything any more.
lightbeam = []

# Enables support for the `perf` jitdump profiler
jitdump = ["wasmtime-jit/jitdump"]

# Enables support for the `VTune` profiler
vtune = ["wasmtime-jit/vtune"]

# Enables parallel compilation of WebAssembly code.
parallel-compilation = ["rayon"]

# Enables support for automatic cache configuration to be enabled in `Config`.
cache = ["wasmtime-cache"]

# Use Cranelift's old x86 backend.
old-x86-backend = ["wasmtime-cranelift/old-x86-backend"]

# Enables support for "async stores" as well as defining host functions as
# `async fn` and calling functions asynchronously.
async = ["wasmtime-fiber", "wasmtime-runtime/async"]

# Enables userfaultfd support in the runtime's pooling allocator when building on Linux
uffd = ["wasmtime-runtime/uffd"]

# Enables support for all architectures in Cranelift, allowing
# cross-compilation using the `wasmtime` crate's API, notably the
# `Engine::precompile_module` function.
all-arch = ["wasmtime-cranelift/all-arch"]

# Enables trap handling using POSIX signals instead of Mach exceptions on MacOS.
# It is useful for applications that do not bind their own exception ports and
# need portable signal handling.

//! This module defines the `ResourceAny` type in the public API of Wasmtime,
//! which represents a dynamically typed resource handle that could either be
//! owned by the guest or the host.
//!
//! This is in contrast with `Resource<T>`, for example, and `ResourceAny` has
//! more "state" behind it. Specifically a `ResourceAny` has a type and a
//! `HostResourceIndex` which points inside of a `HostResourceData` structure
//! inside of a stoer. The `ResourceAny::resource_drop` method, or a conversion
//! to `Resource<T>`, is required to be called to avoid leaking data within a
//! store.

/// Representation of a resource in the component model, either a guest-defined
/// or a host-defined resource.
///
/// This type is similar to [`Resource`] except that it can be used to represent
/// any resource, either host or guest. This type cannot be directly constructed
/// and is only available if the guest returns it to the host (e.g. a function
/// returning a guest-defined resource) or by a conversion from [`Resource`] via
/// [`ResourceAny::try_from_resource`].
/// This type also does not carry a static type parameter `T` for example and
/// does not have as much information about its type.
/// This means that it's possible to get runtime type-errors when
/// using this type because it cannot statically prevent mismatching resource
/// types.
///
/// Like [`Resource`] this type represents either an `own` or a `borrow`
/// resource internally. Unlike [`Resource`], however, a [`ResourceAny`] must
/// always be explicitly destroyed with the [`ResourceAny::resource_drop`]
/// method. This will update internal dynamic state tracking and invoke the
/// WebAssembly-defined destructor for a resource, if any.
///
/// Note that it is required to call `resource_drop` for all instances of
/// [`ResourceAny`]: even borrows. Both borrows and own handles have state
/// associated with them that must be discarded by the time they're done being
/// used.

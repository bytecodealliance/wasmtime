///   discard this resource when the borrow duration has finished.
///
/// * `NOT_IN_TABLE` / `u64::MAX - 1` - this indicates that this is an owned
///   resource not present in any store's table. This resource is not lent
///   out. It can be passed as an `(own $t)` directly into a guest's table
///   or it can be passed as a borrow to a guest which will insert it into
///   a host store's table for dynamic borrow tracking.
///
/// * `TAKEN` / `u64::MAX - 2` - while the `rep` is available the resource
///   has been dynamically moved into a guest and cannot be moved in again.
///   This is used for example to prevent the same resource from being
///   passed twice to a guest.
///
/// * All other values - any other value indicates that the value is an
///   index into a store's table of host resources. It's guaranteed that the
///   table entry represents a host resource and the resource may have
///   borrow tracking associated with it. The low 32-bits of the value are
///   the table index and the upper 32-bits are the generation.
///
/// Note that this is two `AtomicU32` fields but it's not intended to actually
/// be used in conjunction with threads as generally a `Store<T>` lives on one
/// thread at a time. The pair of `AtomicU32` here is used to ensure that this
/// type is `Send + Sync` when captured as a reference to make async

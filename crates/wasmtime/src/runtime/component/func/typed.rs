    ///   instance is currently calling a host function.
    /// * If a previous function call occurred and the corresponding
    ///   `post_return` hasn't been invoked yet.
    ///

//   `ValRaw` values and have a multiple of the size of `ValRaw` and the same
//   alignment.
//
// * The `lower` function must initialize the bits within `Lower` that are going
//   to be read by the trampoline that's used to enter core wasm. A trampoline
//   is passed `*mut Lower` and will read the canonical abi arguments in
//   sequence, so all of the bits must be correctly initialized.
//
// * The `size` and `align` functions must be correct for this value stored in
//   the canonical ABI. The `Cursor<T>` iteration of these bytes rely on this
//   for correctness as they otherwise eschew bounds-checking.
//
// There are likely some other correctness issues which aren't documented as
// well, this isn't intended to be an exhaustive list. It suffices to say,
// though, that correctness bugs in this trait implementation are highly likely
// to lead to security bugs, which again leads to the `unsafe` in the trait.
//
// Also note that this trait specifically is not sealed because we have a proc
// macro that generates implementations of this trait for external types in a

/// Representation of a string located in linear memory in a WebAssembly

/// in some situations. The purpose of this type is to represent a range of
/// validated bytes within a component but does not actually copy the bytes. The
/// primary method, [`WasmStr::to_str`], attempts to return a reference to the
/// string directly located in the component's memory, avoiding a copy into the
/// host if possible.
///
/// The downside of this type, however, is that accessing a string requires a
/// [`Store`](crate::Store) pointer (via [`StoreContext`]). Bindings generated
/// by [`bindgen!`](crate::component::bindgen), for example, do not have access
/// to [`StoreContext`] and thus can't use this type.
///
/// This is intended for more advanced use cases such as defining functions
/// directly in a [`Linker`](crate::component::Linker). It's expected that in
/// the future [`bindgen!`](crate::component::bindgen) will also have a way to
/// use this type.
///
/// This type is used with [`TypedFunc`], for example, when WebAssembly returns
/// a string. This type cannot be used to give a string to WebAssembly, instead
/// `&str` should be used for that (since it's coming from the host).
///
/// Note that this type represents an in-bounds string in linear memory, but it
/// does not represent a valid string (e.g. valid utf-8). Validation happens
/// when [`WasmStr::to_str`] is called.
///
/// Also note that this type does not implement [`Lower`], it only implements

        // the component model's canonical ABI encountered. The rough problem is
        // that let's say we have a component model type of the form:
        //
        //      (result u64 (error (tuple f32 u16)))
        //
        // The flat representation of this is actually pretty tricky. Currently
        // it is:
        //
        //      i32 i64 i32
        //
        // The first `i32` is the discriminant for the `result`, and the payload
        // is represented by `i64 i32`. The "ok" variant will only use the `i64`
        // and the "err" variant will use both `i64` and `i32`.
        //
        // In the "ok" variant the first issue is encountered. The size of one
        // variant may not match the size of the other variants. All variants
        // start at the "front" but when lowering a type we need to be sure to
        // initialize the later variants (lest we leak random host memory into
        // the guest module). Due to how the `Lower` type is represented as a
        // `union` of all the variants what ends up happening here is that
        // internally within the `lower_payload` after the typed payload is
        // lowered the remaining bits of the payload that weren't initialized
        // are all set to zero. This will guarantee that we'll write to all the
        // slots for each variant.
        //
        // The "err" variant encounters the second issue, however, which is that
        // the flat representation for each type may differ between payloads. In
        // the "ok" arm an `i64` is written, but the `lower` implementation for
        // the "err" arm will write an `f32` and then an `i32`. For this
        // implementation of `lower` to be valid the `f32` needs to get inflated
        // to an `i64` with zero-padding in the upper bits. What may be
        // surprising, however, is that none of this is handled in this file.
        // This implementation looks like it's blindly deferring to `E::lower`
        // and hoping it does the right thing.
        //
        // In reality, however, the correctness of variant lowering relies on
        // two subtle details of the `ValRaw` implementation in Wasmtime:
        //
        // 1. First the `ValRaw` value always contains little-endian values.
        //    This means that if a `u32` is written, a `u64` is read, and then
        //    the `u64` has its upper bits truncated the original value will
        //    always be retained. This is primarily here for big-endian
        //    platforms where if it weren't little endian then the opposite
        //    would occur and the wrong value would be read.
        //
        // 2. Second, and perhaps even more subtly, the `ValRaw` constructors
        //    for 32-bit types actually always initialize 64-bits of the
        //    `ValRaw`. In the component model flat ABI only 32 and 64-bit types
        //    are used so 64-bits is big enough to contain everything. This
        //    means that when a `ValRaw` is written into the destination it will
        //    always, whether it's needed or not, be "ready" to get extended up
        //    to 64-bits.
        //
        // Put together these two subtle guarantees means that all `Lower`
        // implementations can be written "naturally" as one might naively
        // expect. Variants will, on each arm, zero out remaining fields and all
        // writes to the flat representation will automatically be 64-bit writes
        // meaning that if the value is read as a 64-bit value, which isn't
        // known at the time of the write, it'll still be correct.

//! Examples of output of the [`bindgen!`] macro.
//!
//! This module is only included in docs.rs documentation and is not present in
//! the actual crate when compiling from crates.io. The purpose of this module
//! is to showcase what the output of the [`bindgen!`] macro looks like and some
//! examples of how to use it.
//!
//! If you're confused or lost in [`bindgen!`] feel free to [open an issue]
//! with a description of your issue and it can hopefully lead to a new example
//! being added here for others to use as reference.
//!
//! ## Including `*.wit` files in your project
//!
//! Note that most of the examples in this module will use the `inline` key of
//! the [`bindgen!`] macro. This is done as it's easy to show the example and
//! WIT all in one self-contained snippet of Rust code. Typically though a
//! project will have a `wit` directory next to `Cargo.toml` which contains WIT
//! files.
//!
//! The general layout of a `wit` directory is that:
//!
//! * All `*.wit` files at `wit/*.wit` are parsed and included in the same
//!   package.
//! * If the `wit/deps` folder is present then it can either contain:
//!   * Subdirectories with a package-per-directory. For example
//!     `wit/deps/wasi-http` and `wit/deps/wasi-cli`.
//!   * WIT files that are a single-file rendering of a package, for example
//!     `wit/deps/wasi-http.wit`
//!   * WIT packages encoded as WebAssembly binaries for a package, for example
//!     `wit/deps/wasi-http.wasm`
//!
//! This means that at this time you'll need to copy around `*.wit` files or
//! WIT packages encoded as `*.wasm` and check them in to your project's `wit`
//! directory. The hope is that in the future it will be easier to manage these
//! files with registry tooling and they won't have to be copied manually.
//! For reference documentation on the layout of the `wit` directory see
//! [`wit_parser::Resolve::push_dir`].

#![allow(missing_docs)]

// This "hack" will shadow the `bindgen` macro in general and be inherited to
// following modules by default. This enables documenting sources as-is while
// additionally customizing them to working within the wasmtime crate itself by
// injecting a configuration option to change how the `wasmtime` crate is
// referenced in the generated output.
//
// Note that this has an additional "hack" such that when docs.rs is documenting
// this crate (or CI) then `include_generated_code_from_file` is unconditionally
// turned on. This makes `[source]` links on documentation show the actual
// generated code rather than just the `bindgen!` macro invocation, which can be
// helpful when exploring code.

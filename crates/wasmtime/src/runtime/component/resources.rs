/// use as a resource with the component model. The main guarantee that the
/// component model provides is that the `u32` is not forgeable by guests and
/// there are guaranteed semantics about when a `u32` may be in use by the guest
/// and when it's guaranteed no longer needed. This means that it is safe for
/// embedders to consider the internal `u32` representation "trusted" and use it
/// for things like table indices with infallible accessors that panic on
/// out-of-bounds. This should only panic for embedder bugs, not because of any
/// possible behavior in the guest.
///
/// A `Resource<T>` value dynamically represents both an `(own $t)` in the
/// component model as well as a `(borrow $t)`. It can be inspected via
/// [`Resource::owned`] to test whether it is an owned handle. An owned handle
/// which is not actively borrowed can be destroyed at any time as it's
/// guaranteed that the guest does not have access to it. A borrowed handle, on
/// the other hand, may be accessed by the guest so it's not necessarily
/// guaranteed to be able to be destroyed.
///
/// Note that the "own" and "borrow" here refer to the component model, not
/// Rust. The semantics of Rust ownership and borrowing are slightly different
/// than the component model's (but spiritually the same) in that more dynamic
/// tracking is employed as part of the component model. This means that it's
/// possible to get runtime errors when using a `Resource<T>`. For example it is
/// an error to call [`Resource::new_borrow`] and pass that to a component
/// function expecting `(own $t)` and this is not statically disallowed.
///
/// The [`Resource`] type implements both the [`Lift`] and [`Lower`] trait to be
/// used with typed functions in the component model or as part of aggregate
/// structures and datatypes.
///
/// # Destruction of a resource
///
/// Resources in the component model are optionally defined with a destructor,
/// but this host resource type does not specify a destructor. It is left up to
/// the embedder to be able to determine how best to a destroy a resource when
/// it is owned.
///
/// Note, though, that while [`Resource`] itself does not specify destructors
/// it's still possible to do so via the [`Linker::resource`] definition. When a
/// resource type is defined for a guest component a destructor can be specified
/// which can be used to hook into resource destruction triggered by the guest.
///
/// This means that there are two ways that resource destruction is handled:
///
/// * Host resources destroyed by the guest can hook into the
///   [`Linker::resource`] destructor closure to handle resource destruction.
///   This could, for example, remove table entries.
///
/// * Host resources owned by the host itself have no automatic means of
///   destruction. The host can make its own determination that its own resource
///   is not lent out to the guest and at that time choose to destroy or
///   deallocate it.
///
/// # Dynamic behavior of a resource
///
/// A host-defined [`Resource`] does not necessarily represent a static value.
/// Its internals may change throughout its usage to track the state associated
/// with the resource. The internal 32-bit host-defined representation never
/// changes, however.
///
/// For example if there's a component model function of the form:
///
/// ```wasm
/// (func (param "a" (borrow $t)) (param "b" (own $t)))
/// ```
///
/// Then that can be extracted in Rust with:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// let func = instance.get_typed_func::<(&Resource<T>, &Resource<T>), ()>(&mut store, "name")?;
/// ```
///
/// Here the exact same resource can be provided as both arguments but that is
/// not valid to do so because the same resource cannot be actively borrowed and
/// passed by-value as the second parameter at the same time. The internal state
/// in `Resource<T>` will track this information and provide a dynamic runtime
/// error in this situation.
///
/// Mostly it's important to be aware that there is dynamic state associated
/// with a [`Resource<T>`] to provide errors in situations that cannot be
/// statically ruled out.
///
/// # Borrows and host responsibilities
///
/// Borrows to resources in the component model are guaranteed to be transient
/// such that if a borrow is passed as part of a function call then when the
/// function returns it's guaranteed that the guest no longer has access to the
/// resource. This guarantee, however, must be manually upheld by the host when
/// it receives its own borrow.
///
/// As mentioned above the [`Resource<T>`] type can represent a borrowed value
/// in addition to an owned value. This means a guest can provide the host with
/// a borrow, such as an argument to an imported function:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// linker.root().func_wrap("name", |_cx, (r,): (Resource<MyType>,)| {
///     assert!(!r.owned());
///     // .. here `r` is a borrowed value provided by the guest and the host
///     // shouldn't continue to access it beyond the scope of this call
/// })?;
/// ```
///
/// In this situation the host should take care to not attempt to persist the
/// resource beyond the scope of the call. It's the host's resource so it
/// technically can do what it wants with it but nothing is statically
/// preventing `r` to stay pinned to the lifetime of the closure invocation.
/// It's considered a mistake that the host performed if `r` is persisted too
/// long and accessed at the wrong time.

///   instance is transiently available. It's the host's responsibility to
///   discard this resource when the borrow duration has finished.
///
/// * `NOT_IN_TABLE` / `u64::MAX - 1` - this indicates that this is an owned
///   resource not present in any store's table. This resource is not lent
///   out. It can be passed as an `(own $t)` directly into a guest's table
///   or it can be passed as a borrow to a guest which will insert it into
///   a host store's table for dynamic borrow tracking.
///
/// * `TAKEN` / `u64::MAX - 2` - while the `rep` is available the resource
///   has been dynamically moved into a guest and cannot be moved in again.
///   This is used for example to prevent the same resource from being
///   passed twice to a guest.
///
/// * All other values - any other value indicates that the value is an
///   index into a store's table of host resources. It's guaranteed that the
///   table entry represents a host resource and the resource may have
///   borrow tracking associated with it. The low 32-bits of the value are
///   the table index and the upper 32-bits are the generation.
///

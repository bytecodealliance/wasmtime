//! Garbage collection rooting APIs.
//!
//! Rooting prevents GC objects from being collected while they are actively
//! being used.
//!
//! ## Goals
//!
//! We have a few sometimes-conflicting goals with our GC rooting APIs:
//!
//! 1. Safety: It should never be possible to get a use-after-free bug because
//!    the user misused the rooting APIs, the collector "mistakenly" determined
//!    an object was unreachable and collected it, and then the user tried to
//!    access the object. This is our highest priority.
//!
//! 2. Moving GC: Our rooting APIs should moving collectors (such as
//!    generational and compacting collectors) where an object might get
//!    relocated after a collection and we need to update the GC root's pointer
//!    to the moved object. This means we either need cooperation and internal
//!    mutability from individual GC roots as well as the ability to enumerate
//!    all GC roots on the native Rust stack, or we need a level of indirection.
//!
//! 3. Performance: Our rooting APIs should generally be as low-overhead as
//!    possible. They definitely shouldn't require synchronization and locking
//!    to create, access, and drop GC roots.
//!
//! 4. Ergonomics: Our rooting APIs should be, if not a pleasure, then at least
//!    not a burden for users. Additionally, the API's types should be `Sync`
//!    and `Send` so that they work well with async Rust.
//!
//! For example, goals (3) and (4) are in conflict when we think about how to
//! support (2). Ideally, for ergonomics, a root would automatically unroot
//! itself when dropped. But in the general case that requires holding a
//! reference to the store's root set, and that root set needs to be held
//! simultaneously by all GC roots, and they each need to mutate the set to
//! unroot themselves. That implies `Rc<RefCell<...>>` or `Arc<Mutex<...>>`! The
//! former makes the store and GC root types not `Send` and not `Sync`. The
//! latter imposes synchronization and locking overhead. So we instead make GC
//! roots indirect and require passing in a store context explicitly to unroot
//! in the general case. This trades worse ergonomics for better performance and
//! support for moving GC.
//!
//! ## Two Flavors of Rooting API
//!
//! Okay, with that out of the way, this module provides two flavors of rooting
//! API. One for the common, scoped lifetime case, and another for the rare case
//! where we really need a GC root with an arbitrary, non-LIFO/non-scoped
//! lifetime:
//!
//! 1. `RootScope` and `Rooted<T>`: These are used for temporarily rooting GC
//!    objects for the duration of a scope. The internal implementation takes
//!    advantage of the LIFO property inherent in scopes, making creating and
//!    dropping `Rooted<T>`s and `RootScope`s super fast and roughly equivalent
//!    to bump allocation.
//!
//!    This type is vaguely similar to V8's [`HandleScope`].
//!
//!    [`HandleScope`]: https://v8.github.io/api/head/classv8_1_1HandleScope.html
//!
//!    Note that `Rooted<T>` can't be statically tied to its context scope via a
//!    lifetime parameter, unfortunately, as that would allow the creation of
//!    only one `Rooted<T>` at a time, since the `Rooted<T>` would take a borrow
//!    of the whole context.
//!
//!    This supports the common use case for rooting and provides good
//!    ergonomics.
//!
//! 2. `ManuallyRooted<T>`: This is the fully general rooting API used for
//!    holding onto non-LIFO GC roots with arbitrary lifetimes. However, users
//!    must manually unroot them. Failure to manually unroot a
//!    `ManuallyRooted<T>` before it is dropped will result in the GC object
//!    (and everything it transitively references) leaking for the duration of
//!    the `Store`'s lifetime.
//!
//!    This type is roughly similar to SpiderMonkey's [`PersistentRooted<T>`],
//!    although they avoid the manual-unrooting with internal mutation and
//!    shared references. (Our constraints mean we can't do those things, as
//!    mentioned explained above.)
//!
//!    [`PersistentRooted<T>`]: http://devdoc.net/web/developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/JSAPI_reference/JS::PersistentRooted.html
//!
//! At the end of the day, both `Rooted<T>` and `ManuallyRooted<T>` are just
//! tagged indices into the store's `RootSet`. This indirection allows working
//! with Rust's borrowing discipline (we use `&mut Store` to represent mutable
//! access to the GC heap) while still allowing rooted references to be moved
//! around without tying up the whole store in borrows. Additionally, and
//! crucially, this indirection allows us to update the *actual* GC pointers in
//! the `RootSet` and support moving GCs (again, as mentioned above).
//!
//! ## Unrooted References
//!
//! We generally don't expose *unrooted* GC references in the Wasmtime API at
//! this time -- and I expect it will be a very long time before we do, but in
//! the limit we may want to let users define their own GC-managed types that
//! participate in GC tracing and all that -- so we don't have to worry about
//! failure to root an object causing use-after-free bugs or failing to update a
//! GC root pointer after a moving GC as long as users stick to our safe rooting
//! APIs. (The one exception is `ValRaw`, which does hold raw GC references. But
//! with `ValRaw` all bets are off and safety is 100% up to the user.)
//!
//! We do, however, have to worry about these things internally. So first of
//! all, try to avoid ever working with unrooted GC references if you
//! can. However, if you really must, consider also using an `AutoAssertNoGc`
//! across the block of code that is manipulating raw GC references.

/// aka stack order) lifetimes. This is in contrast to
/// [`ManuallyRooted<T>`][crate::ManuallyRooted], which supports rooting GC
/// objects for arbitrary lifetimes, but requires manual unrooting.
///
/// | Type                                         | Supported Lifetimes         | Unrooting |
/// |----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------|
/// | [`Rooted<T>`][crate::Rooted]                 | Strictly LIFO / stack order | Automatic |
/// | [`ManuallyRooted<T>`][crate::ManuallyRooted] | Arbitrary                   | Manual    |
///
/// `Rooted<T>` should suffice for most use cases, and provides better
/// ergonomics, but `ManuallyRooted<T>` exists as a fully-general escape hatch.
///
/// # Scopes
///
/// Wasmtime automatically creates two kinds of scopes:
///
/// 1. A [`Store`][crate::Store] is the outermost rooting scope. Creating a
///    `Root<T>` directly inside a `Store` permanently roots the underlying
///    object, similar to dropping a
///    [`ManuallyRooted<T>`][crate::ManuallyRooted] without unrooting it.
///
/// 2. A [`Caller`][crate::Caller] provides a rooting scope for the duration of
///    a call from Wasm into a host function. Any objects rooted in a `Caller`
///    will be unrooted after the host function returns. Note that there can be
///    nested `Caller` scopes in the case where Wasm calls a host function,
///    creating the first `Caller` and its rooting scope , and then the host
///    function calls a Wasm function which then calls another host function,
///    creating a second `Caller` and a second rooting scope. This nesting can
///    be arbitrarily deep.
///
/// Additionally, if you would like to define finer-grained rooting scopes,
/// Wasmtime provides the [`RootScope`][crate::RootScope] type.
///
/// Scopes are always nested in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) order. An outer scope
/// is never exited (and the `Rooted<T>`s defined within it are never
/// automatically unrooted) while an inner scope is still active. All inner
/// scopes are exited before their outer scopes.
///
/// The following diagram illustrates various rooting scopes over time, how they
/// nest, and when their `Rooted<T>`s are automatically unrooted:
///
/// ```text
/// ----- new Store
///   |
///   |
///   | let a: Rooted<T> = ...;

/// being collected by the GC until [`unroot`][crate::ManuallyRooted::unroot] is
/// explicitly called.
///
/// The primary way to create a `ManuallyRooted<T>` is to promote a temporary
/// `Rooted<T>` into a `ManuallyRooted<T>` via its
/// [`to_manually_rooted`][crate::Rooted::to_manually_rooted] method.
///
/// `ManuallyRooted<T>` dereferences to its underlying `T`, allowing you to call
/// `T`'s methods.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// # use wasmtime::*;
/// # fn _foo() -> Result<()> {
/// let mut store = Store::<Option<ManuallyRooted<ExternRef>>>::default();
///
/// // Create our `ManuallyRooted` in a nested scope to avoid rooting it for
/// // the duration of the store's lifetime.
/// let x = {
///     let mut scope = RootScope::new(&mut store);
///     let x = ExternRef::new(&mut scope, 1234)?;
///     x.to_manually_rooted(&mut scope)?
/// };
///
/// // Place `x` into our store.
/// *store.data_mut() = Some(x);
///
/// // Do a bunch stuff that may or may not access, replace, or take `x`...
///
/// // At any time, in any arbitrary scope, we can remove `x` from the store
/// // and unroot it:
/// if let Some(x) = store.data_mut().take() {
///     x.unroot(&mut store);
/// }
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// # Differences Between `ManuallyRooted<T>` and `Rooted<T>`
///
/// While `ManuallyRooted<T>` can have arbitrary lifetimes, it requires manual
/// unrooting. This is in contrast to [`Rooted<T>`][crate::Rooted] which is
/// restricted to strictly last-in-first-out (LIFO, aka stack order) lifetimes,
/// but comes with automatic unrooting.
///
/// | Type                                         | Supported Lifetimes         | Unrooting |
/// |----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------|
/// | [`Rooted<T>`][crate::Rooted]                 | Strictly LIFO / stack order | Automatic |
/// | [`ManuallyRooted<T>`][crate::ManuallyRooted] | Arbitrary                   | Manual    |
///
/// `Rooted<T>` should suffice for most use cases, and provides better
/// ergonomics, but `ManuallyRooted<T>` exists as a fully-general escape hatch.
///
/// # Manual Unrooting
///
/// Failure to explicitly call [`unroot`][crate::ManuallyRooted::unroot] (or
/// another method that consumes `self` and unroots the reference, such as
/// [`into_rooted`][crate::ManuallyRooted::into_rooted]) will leak the
/// underlying GC object, preventing it from being garbage collected until its
/// owning [`Store`][crate::Store] is dropped. That means all of the following
/// will result in permanently rooting the underlying GC object:
///
/// * Implicitly dropping a `ManuallyRooted<T>`:
///
///   ```no_run
///   # use wasmtime::*;
///   # let get_manually_rooted = || -> ManuallyRooted<ExternRef> { todo!() };
///   {
///       let perma_root: ManuallyRooted<_> = get_manually_rooted();
///
///       // `perma_root` is implicitly dropped at the end of its scope,
///       // permanently rooting/leaking its referent.
///   }
///   ```
///
/// * Explicitly dropping a `ManuallyRooted<T>`: `drop(my_manually_rooted)`.
///
/// * Forgetting a `ManuallyRooted<T>`: `std::mem::forget(my_manually_rooted)`.
///
/// * Inserting a `ManuallyRooted<T>` into a `std::sync::Arc` or `std::rc::Rc`
///   cycle.
///
/// * Etc...
///
/// Wasmtime does *not* assert that a `ManuallyRooted<T>` is unrooted on `Drop`,
/// or otherwise raise a panic, log a warning, or etc... on failure to manually
/// unroot. Sometimes leaking is intentional and desirable, particularly when
/// dealing with short-lived [`Store`][crate::Store]s where unrooting would just
/// be busy work since the whole store is about to be dropped.

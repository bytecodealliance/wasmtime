//! Garbage collection rooting APIs.
//!
//! Rooting prevents GC objects from being collected while they are actively
//! being used.
//!
//! ## Goals
//!
//! We have a few sometimes-conflicting goals with our GC rooting APIs:
//!
//! 1. Safety: It should never be possible to get a use-after-free bug because
//!    the user misused the rooting APIs, the collector "mistakenly" determined
//!    an object was unreachable and collected it, and then the user tried to
//!    access the object. This is our highest priority.
//!
//! 2. Moving GC: Our rooting APIs should moving collectors (such as
//!    generational and compacting collectors) where an object might get
//!    relocated after a collection and we need to update the GC root's pointer
//!    to the moved object. This means we either need cooperation and internal
//!    mutability from individual GC roots as well as the ability to enumerate
//!    all GC roots on the native Rust stack, or we need a level of indirection.
//!
//! 3. Performance: Our rooting APIs should generally be as low-overhead as
//!    possible. They definitely shouldn't require synchronization and locking
//!    to create, access, and drop GC roots.
//!
//! 4. Ergonomics: Our rooting APIs should be, if not a pleasure, then at least
//!    not a burden for users. Additionally, the API's types should be `Sync`
//!    and `Send` so that they work well with async Rust.
//!
//! The two main design axes that trade off the above goals are:
//!
//! - Where the GC reference itself is held. A root object could
//!   directly hold the underlying GC reference (offset into the GC
//!   storage area), which would allow more efficient dereferencing
//!   and access to the referred-to GC object. However, goal (2)
//!   requires that the GC is able to update references when objects
//!   move during a GC. Thus, such "direct roots" would need to be
//!   registered somehow in a global root registry, and would need to
//!   unregister themselves when dropped.
//!
//!   The alternative is to hold some indirect kind of reference to a
//!   GC reference, with the latter stored directly in the `Store` so
//!   the GC can update it freely. This adds one pointer-chasing hop
//!   to accesses, but works much more nicely with ownership
//!   semantics. Logically, the `Store` "owns" the actual pointers;
//!   and rooting types own the slots that they are stored in.
//!
//!   For the above reasons, all of our rooting types below use
//!   indirection. This avoids the need for an unsafe
//!   intrusive-linked-list for global registration, or a shared
//!   reference to a mutex-protected registry, or some other
//!   error-prone technique.
//!
//! - How unrooting occurs. Ideally, a rooting type would implement
//!   the Rust `Drop` trait and unroot itself when the Rust value is
//!   dropped. However, because the rooting state is held in the
//!   `Store`, this direct approach would imply keeping a shared,
//!   mutex-protected handle to the registry in every rooting
//!   object. This would add synchronization overhead to the common
//!   case, and in general would be a bad tradeoff.
//!
//!   However, there are several other approaches:
//!
//!   - The user could use an RAII wrapper that *does* own the `Store`,
//!     and defines a "scope" in which roots are created and then
//!     bulk-unrooted at the close of the scope.
//!   - The rooting type could hold a shared reference to some state
//!     *other* than the full registry, and update a flag in that
//!     state indicating it has been dropped; the `Store` could then
//!     later observe that flag and remove the root. This would have
//!     some allocation cost, but the shared state would be
//!     independent of the `Store` and specific to each root, so would
//!     impose no synchronization overhead between different roots or
//!     the GC itself.
//!   - The rooting type could provide a fully manual `unroot` method,
//!     allowing the user to make use of their own knowledge of their
//!     application's lifetimes and semantics and remove roots when
//!     appropriate.
//!
//!   We provide an implementation of the first two of these
//!   strategies below in `Rooted` and `OwnedRooted`. The last, fully
//!   manual, approach is too difficult to use correctly (it cannot
//!   implement Rust's `Drop` trait, but there is no way in Rust to
//!   enforce that a value must be consumed rather than dropped) so it
//!   is not implemented.
//!
//! ## Two Flavors of Rooting API
//!
//! Okay, with that out of the way, this module provides two flavors
//! of rooting API. One for the common, scoped lifetime case, and one that
//! carries ownership until dropped, and can work as an RAII handle
//! that interacts well with Rust ownership semantics (but at a minor
//! performance cost):
//!
//! 1. `RootScope` and `Rooted<T>`: These are used for temporarily rooting GC
//!    objects for the duration of a scope. The internal implementation takes
//!    advantage of the LIFO property inherent in scopes, making creating and
//!    dropping `Rooted<T>`s and `RootScope`s super fast and roughly equivalent
//!    to bump allocation.
//!
//!    This type is vaguely similar to V8's [`HandleScope`].
//!
//!    [`HandleScope`]: https://v8.github.io/api/head/classv8_1_1HandleScope.html
//!
//!    Note that `Rooted<T>` can't be statically tied to its context scope via a
//!    lifetime parameter, unfortunately, as that would allow the creation of
//!    only one `Rooted<T>` at a time, since the `Rooted<T>` would take a borrow
//!    of the whole context.
//!
//!    This supports the common use case for rooting and provides good
//!    ergonomics.
//!
//! 2. `OwnedRooted<T>`: This is a root that manages rooting and
//!    unrooting automatically with its lifetime as a Rust value. In
//!    other words, the continued existence of the Rust value ensures
//!    the rooting of the underlying GC reference; and when the Rust
//!    value is dropped, the underlying GC reference is no longer
//!    rooted.
//!
//!    Internally, this root holds a shared reference to a
//!    *root-specific* bit of state that is also tracked and observed
//!    by the `Store`.  This means that there is minor memory
//!    allocation overhead (an `Arc<()>`) for each such root; this
//!    memory is shared over all clones of this root. The rooted GC
//!    reference is *logically* unrooted as soon as the last clone of
//!    this root is dropped. Internally the root may still exist until
//!    the next GC, or "root trim" when another `OwnedRooted` is
//!    created, but that is unobservable externally, and will not
//!    result in any additional GC object lifetime because it is
//!    always cleaned up before a gc.
//!
//!    This type is roughly similar to SpiderMonkey's [`PersistentRooted<T>`],
//!    although they register roots on a per-thread `JSContext`, avoiding
//!    mutation costs in a way that is not viable for Wasmtime (which needs
//!    `Store`s to be `Send`).
//!
//!    [`PersistentRooted<T>`]: http://devdoc.net/web/developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/JSAPI_reference/JS::PersistentRooted.html
//!
//! At the end of the day, all of the above root types are just tagged
//! indices into the store's `RootSet`. This indirection allows
//! working with Rust's borrowing discipline (we use `&mut Store` to
//! represent mutable access to the GC heap) while still allowing
//! rooted references to be moved around without tying up the whole
//! store in borrows. Additionally, and crucially, this indirection
//! allows us to update the *actual* GC pointers in the `RootSet` and
//! support moving GCs (again, as mentioned above).
//!
//! ## Unrooted References
//!
//! We generally don't expose *unrooted* GC references in the Wasmtime API at
//! this time -- and I expect it will be a very long time before we do, but in
//! the limit we may want to let users define their own GC-managed types that
//! participate in GC tracing and all that -- so we don't have to worry about
//! failure to root an object causing use-after-free bugs or failing to update a
//! GC root pointer after a moving GC as long as users stick to our safe rooting
//! APIs. (The one exception is `ValRaw`, which does hold raw GC references. But
//! with `ValRaw` all bets are off and safety is 100% up to the user.)
//!
//! We do, however, have to worry about these things internally. So first of
//! all, try to avoid ever working with unrooted GC references if you
//! can. However, if you really must, consider also using an `AutoAssertNoGc`
//! across the block of code that is manipulating raw GC references.

    /// liveness flags during a periodic scan and actually deallocate
    /// the roots. We use an `Arc<()>` for this: it permits cheap

    /// ref in a list alongside the actual `GcRootIndex`, and we free
    /// that index in the slab of owned roots when we observe that
    /// only our weak ref remains.
    ///
    /// This trim step is logically separate from a full GC, though it
    /// would not be very productive to do a GC without doing a
    /// root-trim first: the root-trim should be quite a lot cheaper,
    /// and it will allow for more garbage to exist.
    ///
    /// There is, additionally, nothing stopping us from doing trims
    /// more often than just before each GC, and there are reasons
    /// this could be a good idea: for example, a user program that
    /// creates and removes many roots (perhaps as it accesses the GC
    /// object graph) but ultimately is dealing with a static graph,
    /// without further allocation, may need the "root set" to be GC'd
    /// independently from the actual heap. Thus, we could trim before
    /// adding a new root to ensure we don't grow that unboundedly (or
    /// force an otherwise unneeded GC).
    ///
    /// The first case, just before GC, wants a "full trim": there's
    /// no reason not to unroot as much as possible before we do the
    /// expensive work of tracing the whole heap.
    ///
    /// On the other hand, the second case, adding a new root, wants a
    /// kind of trim that is amortized constant time. Consider: if we
    /// have some threshold for the trim, say N roots, and the user
    /// program continually adds and removes one root such that it
    /// goes just over the threshold, we might scan all N liveness
    /// flags for each step, resulting in quadratic behavior overall.

/// contrast to [`OwnedRooted<T>`][crate::OwnedRooted], which supports

///
/// | Type                                         | Supported Lifetimes         | Unrooting | Cost                             |
/// |----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------|
/// | [`Rooted<T>`][crate::Rooted]                 | Strictly LIFO / stack order | Automatic | very low (LIFO array)            |
/// | [`OwnedRooted<T>`][crate::OwnedRooted]       | Arbitrary                   | Automatic | medium (separate `Arc` to track) |
///
/// `Rooted<T>` should suffice for most use cases, and provides decent
/// ergonomics. In cases where LIFO scopes are difficult to reason
/// about, e.g. heap-managed data structures, or when they may cause
/// erroneous behavior, e.g. in errors that are propagated up the call
/// stack, `OwnedRooted<T>` provides very safe ergonomics but at a
/// small dynamic cost for the separate tracking allocation.
///
/// # Scopes
///
/// Wasmtime automatically creates two kinds of scopes:
///
/// 1. A [`Store`][crate::Store] is the outermost rooting scope. Creating a
///    `Root<T>` directly inside a `Store` permanently roots the underlying
///    object.
///
/// 2. A [`Caller`][crate::Caller] provides a rooting scope for the duration of
///    a call from Wasm into a host function. Any objects rooted in a `Caller`
///    will be unrooted after the host function returns. Note that there can be
///    nested `Caller` scopes in the case where Wasm calls a host function,
///    creating the first `Caller` and its rooting scope , and then the host
///    function calls a Wasm function which then calls another host function,
///    creating a second `Caller` and a second rooting scope. This nesting can
///    be arbitrarily deep.
///
/// Additionally, if you would like to define finer-grained rooting scopes,
/// Wasmtime provides the [`RootScope`][crate::RootScope] type.
///
/// Scopes are always nested in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) order. An outer scope
/// is never exited (and the `Rooted<T>`s defined within it are never
/// automatically unrooted) while an inner scope is still active. All inner
/// scopes are exited before their outer scopes.
///
/// The following diagram illustrates various rooting scopes over time, how they
/// nest, and when their `Rooted<T>`s are automatically unrooted:
///
/// ```text
/// ----- new Store
///   |
///   |
///   | let a: Rooted<T> = ...;

/// underlying `C`, for example in the [`Global::get`][crate::Global::get]
/// method. Any `Rooted<T>`s created by a method that a `RootScope<C>` was
/// passed as context to are tied to the `RootScope<C>`'s scope and
/// automatically unrooted when the scope is dropped.

//! Unix-specific extension for the `wasmtime` crate.
//!
//! This module is only available on Unix targets, for example Linux. Note that
//! this module is notably not available on macOS or Windows.  Note that the
//! import path for this module is `wasmtime::unix::...`, which is intended to
//! emphasize that it is platform-specific.
//!
//! The traits contained in this module are intended to extend various types
//! throughout the `wasmtime` crate with extra functionality that's only
//! available on Unix.

//! Wasmtime's "store" type
//!
//! This module, and its submodules, contain the `Store` type and various types
//! used to interact with it. At first glance this is a pretty confusing module
//! where you need to know the difference between:
//!
//! * `Store<T>`
//! * `StoreContext<T>`
//! * `StoreContextMut<T>`
//! * `AsContext`
//! * `AsContextMut`
//! * `StoreInner<T>`
//! * `StoreOpaque`
//! * `StoreData`
//!
//! There's... quite a lot going on here, and it's easy to be confused. This
//! comment is ideally going to serve the purpose of clarifying what all these
//! types are for and why they're motivated.
//!
//! First it's important to know what's "internal" and what's "external". Almost
//! everything above is defined as `pub`, but only some of the items are
//! reexported to the outside world to be usable from this crate. Otherwise all
//! items are `pub` within this `store` module, and the `store` module is
//! private to the `wasmtime` crate. Notably `Store<T>`, `StoreContext<T>`,
//! `StoreContextMut<T>`, `AsContext`, and `AsContextMut` are all public
//! interfaces to the `wasmtime` crate. You can think of these as:
//!
//! * `Store<T>` - an owned reference to a store, the "root of everything"
//! * `StoreContext<T>` - basically `&StoreInner<T>`
//! * `StoreContextMut<T>` - more-or-less `&mut StoreInner<T>` with caveats.
//!   Explained later.
//! * `AsContext` - similar to `AsRef`, but produces `StoreContext<T>`
//! * `AsContextMut` - similar to `AsMut`, but produces `StoreContextMut<T>`
//!
//! Next comes the internal structure of the `Store<T>` itself. This looks like:
//!
//! * `Store<T>` - this type is just a pointer large. It's primarily just
//!   intended to be consumed by the outside world. Note that the "just a
//!   pointer large" is a load-bearing implementation detail in Wasmtime. This
//!   enables it to store a pointer to its own trait object which doesn't need
//!   to change over time.
//!
//! * `StoreInner<T>` - the first layer of the contents of a `Store<T>`, what's
//!   stored inside the `Box`. This is the general Rust pattern when one struct
//!   is a layer over another. The surprising part, though, is that this is
//!   further subdivided. This structure only contains things which actually
//!   need `T` itself. The downside of this structure is that it's always
//!   generic and means that code is monomorphized into consumer crates. We
//!   strive to have things be as monomorphic as possible in `wasmtime` so this
//!   type is not heavily used.
//!
//! * `StoreOpaque` - this is the primary contents of the `StoreInner<T>` type.
//!   Stored inline in the outer type the "opaque" here means that it's a
//!   "store" but it doesn't have access to the `T`. This is the primary
//!   "internal" reference that Wasmtime uses since `T` is rarely needed by the
//!   internals of Wasmtime.
//!
//! * `StoreData` - this is a final helper struct stored within `StoreOpaque`.
//!   All references of Wasm items into a `Store` are actually indices into a
//!   table in this structure, and the `StoreData` being separate makes it a bit
//!   easier to manage/define/work with. There's no real fundamental reason this
//!   is split out, although sometimes it's useful to have separate borrows into
//!   these tables than the `StoreOpaque`.
//!
//! A major caveat with these representations is that the internal `&mut
//! StoreInner<T>` is never handed out publicly to consumers of this crate, only
//! through a wrapper of `StoreContextMut<'_, T>`. The reason for this is that
//! we want to provide mutable, but not destructive, access to the contents of a
//! `Store`. For example if a `StoreInner<T>` were replaced with some other
//! `StoreInner<T>` then that would drop live instances, possibly those
//! currently executing beneath the current stack frame. This would not be a
//! safe operation.
//!
//! This means, though, that the `wasmtime` crate, which liberally uses `&mut
//! StoreOpaque` internally, has to be careful to never actually destroy the
//! contents of `StoreOpaque`. This is an invariant that we, as the authors of
//! `wasmtime`, must uphold for the public interface to be safe.

/// A [`Store`] is a collection of WebAssembly instances and host-defined state.
///
/// All WebAssembly instances and items will be attached to and refer to a
/// [`Store`]. For example instances, functions, globals, and tables are all
/// attached to a [`Store`]. Instances are created by instantiating a
/// [`Module`](crate::Module) within a [`Store`].
///
/// A [`Store`] is intended to be a short-lived object in a program. No form
/// of GC is implemented at this time so once an instance is created within a
/// [`Store`] it will not be deallocated until the [`Store`] itself is dropped.
/// This makes [`Store`] unsuitable for creating an unbounded number of
/// instances in it because [`Store`] will never release this memory. It's
/// recommended to have a [`Store`] correspond roughly to the lifetime of a
/// "main instance" that an embedding is interested in executing.
///
/// ## Type parameter `T`
///
/// Each [`Store`] has a type parameter `T` associated with it. This `T`
/// represents state defined by the host. This state will be accessible through
/// the [`Caller`](crate::Caller) type that host-defined functions get access
/// to. This `T` is suitable for storing `Store`-specific information which
/// imported functions may want access to.
///
/// The data `T` can be accessed through methods like [`Store::data`] and
/// [`Store::data_mut`].
///
/// ## Stores, contexts, oh my
///
/// Most methods in Wasmtime take something of the form
/// [`AsContext`](crate::AsContext) or [`AsContextMut`](crate::AsContextMut) as
/// the first argument. These two traits allow ergonomically passing in the
/// context you currently have to any method. The primary two sources of
/// contexts are:
///
/// * `Store<T>`
/// * `Caller<'_, T>`
///
/// corresponding to what you create and what you have access to in a host
/// function. You can also explicitly acquire a [`StoreContext`] or
/// [`StoreContextMut`] and pass that around as well.
///
/// Note that all methods on [`Store`] are mirrored onto [`StoreContext`],
/// [`StoreContextMut`], and [`Caller`](crate::Caller). This way no matter what
/// form of context you have you can call various methods, create objects, etc.
///
/// ## Stores and `Default`
///
/// You can create a store with default configuration settings using
/// `Store::default()`. This will create a brand new [`Engine`] with default
/// configuration (see [`Config`](crate::Config) for more information).
///
/// ## Cross-store usage of items
///
/// In `wasmtime` wasm items such as [`Global`] and [`Memory`] "belong" to a
/// [`Store`]. The store they belong to is the one they were created with
/// (passed in as a parameter) or instantiated with. This store is the only
/// store that can be used to interact with wasm items after they're created.
///
/// The `wasmtime` crate will panic if the [`Store`] argument passed in to these
/// operations is incorrect. In other words it's considered a programmer error
/// rather than a recoverable error for the wrong [`Store`] to be used when
/// calling APIs.

        //   `T` and the destructor for `StoreInner<T>`. We do, however, run the

        //   the destructor for `T` since it's `ManuallyDrop`.
        //
        // In both cases all the other fields of `StoreInner<T>` should all get
        // dropped, and the manual management of destructors is basically
        // between this method and `Drop for Store<T>`. Note that this also

        // Nothing too weird about the `Send`-ness, values aren't actually
        // crossing threads.
        //
        // The really interesting piece is `fiber`. Now the "fiber" here is
        // actual honest-to-god Rust code which we're moving around. What we're
        // doing is the equivalent of moving our thread's stack to another OS

        // and would generally have no way to verify that this is actually safe
        // to do!
        //
        // Thankfully, though, Wasmtime has the power. Without being glib it's
        // actually worth examining what's on the stack. It's unfortunately not
        // super-local to this function itself. Our closure to `Fiber::new` runs
        // `func`, which is given to us from the outside. Thankfully, though, we
        // have tight control over this. Usage of `on_fiber` is typically done
        // *just* before entering WebAssembly itself, so we'll have a few stack
        // frames of Rust code (all in Wasmtime itself) before we enter wasm.
        //
        // Once we've entered wasm, well then we have a whole bunch of wasm
        // frames on the stack. We've got this nifty thing called Cranelift,
        // though, which allows us to also have complete control over everything
        // on the stack!
        //
        // Finally, when wasm switches back to the fiber's starting pointer
        // (this future we're returning) then it means wasm has reentered Rust.
        // Suspension can only happen via the `block_on` function of an
        // `AsyncCx`. This, conveniently, also happens entirely in Wasmtime
        // controlled code!
        //
        // There's an extremely important point that should be called out here.
        // User-provided futures **are not on the stack** during suspension
        // points. This is extremely crucial because we in general cannot reason
        // about Send/Sync for stack-local variables since rustc doesn't analyze
        // them at all. With our construction, though, we are guaranteed that
        // Wasmtime owns all stack frames between the stack of a fiber and when
        // the fiber suspends (and it could move across threads). At this time
        // the only user-provided piece of data on the stack is the future
        // itself given to us. Lo-and-behold as you might notice the future is
        // required to be `Send`!
        //
        // What this all boils down to is that we, as the authors of Wasmtime,
        // need to be extremely careful that on the async fiber stack we only
        // store Send things. For example we can't start using `Rc` willy nilly
        // by accident and leave a copy in TLS somewhere. (similarly we have to
        // be ready for TLS to change while we're executing wasm code between
        // suspension points).
        //
        // While somewhat onerous it shouldn't be too too hard (the TLS bit is
        // the hardest bit so far). This does mean, though, that no user should
        // ever have to worry about the `Send`-ness of Wasmtime. If rustc says
        // it's ok, then it's ok.
        //
        // With all that in mind we unsafely assert here that wasmtime is
        // correct. We declare the fiber as only containing Send data on its
        // stack, despite not knowing for sure at compile time that this is

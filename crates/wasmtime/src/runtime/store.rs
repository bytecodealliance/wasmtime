//! Wasmtime's "store" type
//!
//! This module, and its submodules, contain the `Store` type and various types
//! used to interact with it. At first glance this is a pretty confusing module
//! where you need to know the difference between:
//!
//! * `Store<T>`
//! * `StoreContext<T>`
//! * `StoreContextMut<T>`
//! * `AsContext`
//! * `AsContextMut`
//! * `StoreInner<T>`
//! * `StoreOpaque`
//! * `StoreData`
//!
//! There's... quite a lot going on here, and it's easy to be confused. This
//! comment is ideally going to serve the purpose of clarifying what all these
//! types are for and why they're motivated.
//!
//! First it's important to know what's "internal" and what's "external". Almost
//! everything above is defined as `pub`, but only some of the items are
//! reexported to the outside world to be usable from this crate. Otherwise all
//! items are `pub` within this `store` module, and the `store` module is
//! private to the `wasmtime` crate. Notably `Store<T>`, `StoreContext<T>`,
//! `StoreContextMut<T>`, `AsContext`, and `AsContextMut` are all public
//! interfaces to the `wasmtime` crate. You can think of these as:
//!
//! * `Store<T>` - an owned reference to a store, the "root of everything"
//! * `StoreContext<T>` - basically `&StoreInner<T>`
//! * `StoreContextMut<T>` - more-or-less `&mut StoreInner<T>` with caveats.
//!   Explained later.
//! * `AsContext` - similar to `AsRef`, but produces `StoreContext<T>`
//! * `AsContextMut` - similar to `AsMut`, but produces `StoreContextMut<T>`
//!
//! Next comes the internal structure of the `Store<T>` itself. This looks like:
//!
//! * `Store<T>` - this type is just a pointer large. It's primarily just
//!   intended to be consumed by the outside world. Note that the "just a
//!   pointer large" is a load-bearing implementation detail in Wasmtime. This
//!   enables it to store a pointer to its own trait object which doesn't need
//!   to change over time.
//!
//! * `StoreInner<T>` - the first layer of the contents of a `Store<T>`, what's
//!   stored inside the `Box`. This is the general Rust pattern when one struct
//!   is a layer over another. The surprising part, though, is that this is
//!   further subdivided. This structure only contains things which actually
//!   need `T` itself. The downside of this structure is that it's always
//!   generic and means that code is monomorphized into consumer crates. We
//!   strive to have things be as monomorphic as possible in `wasmtime` so this
//!   type is not heavily used.
//!
//! * `StoreOpaque` - this is the primary contents of the `StoreInner<T>` type.
//!   Stored inline in the outer type the "opaque" here means that it's a
//!   "store" but it doesn't have access to the `T`. This is the primary
//!   "internal" reference that Wasmtime uses since `T` is rarely needed by the
//!   internals of Wasmtime.
//!
//! * `StoreData` - this is a final helper struct stored within `StoreOpaque`.
//!   All references of Wasm items into a `Store` are actually indices into a
//!   table in this structure, and the `StoreData` being separate makes it a bit
//!   easier to manage/define/work with. There's no real fundamental reason this
//!   is split out, although sometimes it's useful to have separate borrows into
//!   these tables than the `StoreOpaque`.
//!
//! A major caveat with these representations is that the internal `&mut
//! StoreInner<T>` is never handed out publicly to consumers of this crate, only
//! through a wrapper of `StoreContextMut<'_, T>`. The reason for this is that
//! we want to provide mutable, but not destructive, access to the contents of a
//! `Store`. For example if a `StoreInner<T>` were replaced with some other
//! `StoreInner<T>` then that would drop live instances, possibly those
//! currently executing beneath the current stack frame. This would not be a
//! safe operation.
//!
//! This means, though, that the `wasmtime` crate, which liberally uses `&mut
//! StoreOpaque` internally, has to be careful to never actually destroy the
//! contents of `StoreOpaque`. This is an invariant that we, as the authors of
//! `wasmtime`, must uphold for the public interface to be safe.

/// A [`Store`] is a collection of WebAssembly instances and host-defined state.
///
/// All WebAssembly instances and items will be attached to and refer to a
/// [`Store`]. For example instances, functions, globals, and tables are all
/// attached to a [`Store`]. Instances are created by instantiating a
/// [`Module`](crate::Module) within a [`Store`].
///
/// A [`Store`] is intended to be a short-lived object in a program. No form
/// of GC is implemented at this time so once an instance is created within a
/// [`Store`] it will not be deallocated until the [`Store`] itself is dropped.
/// This makes [`Store`] unsuitable for creating an unbounded number of
/// instances in it because [`Store`] will never release this memory. It's
/// recommended to have a [`Store`] correspond roughly to the lifetime of a
/// "main instance" that an embedding is interested in executing.
///
/// ## Type parameter `T`
///
/// Each [`Store`] has a type parameter `T` associated with it. This `T`
/// represents state defined by the host. This state will be accessible through
/// the [`Caller`](crate::Caller) type that host-defined functions get access
/// to. This `T` is suitable for storing `Store`-specific information which
/// imported functions may want access to.
///
/// The data `T` can be accessed through methods like [`Store::data`] and
/// [`Store::data_mut`].
///
/// ## Stores, contexts, oh my
///
/// Most methods in Wasmtime take something of the form
/// [`AsContext`](crate::AsContext) or [`AsContextMut`](crate::AsContextMut) as
/// the first argument. These two traits allow ergonomically passing in the
/// context you currently have to any method. The primary two sources of
/// contexts are:
///
/// * `Store<T>`
/// * `Caller<'_, T>`
///
/// corresponding to what you create and what you have access to in a host
/// function. You can also explicitly acquire a [`StoreContext`] or
/// [`StoreContextMut`] and pass that around as well.
///
/// Note that all methods on [`Store`] are mirrored onto [`StoreContext`],
/// [`StoreContextMut`], and [`Caller`](crate::Caller). This way no matter what
/// form of context you have you can call various methods, create objects, etc.
///
/// ## Stores and `Default`
///
/// You can create a store with default configuration settings using
/// `Store::default()`. This will create a brand new [`Engine`] with default
/// configuration (see [`Config`](crate::Config) for more information).
///
/// ## Cross-store usage of items
///
/// In `wasmtime` wasm items such as [`Global`] and [`Memory`] "belong" to a
/// [`Store`]. The store they belong to is the one they were created with
/// (passed in as a parameter) or instantiated with. This store is the only
/// store that can be used to interact with wasm items after they're created.
///
/// The `wasmtime` crate will panic if the [`Store`] argument passed in to these
/// operations is incorrect. In other words it's considered a programmer error
/// rather than a recoverable error for the wrong [`Store`] to be used when
/// calling APIs.

        //   `StoreInner<T>`. This cleans up all internal fields and doesn't
        //   touch `T` because it's wrapped in `ManuallyDrop`.

        //   `Store<T>` with `mem::forget`. This skips both the destructor for
        //   `T` and the destructor for `StoreInner<T>`. We do, however, run the

        //   the destructor for `T` since it's `ManuallyDrop`.
        //
        // In both cases all the other fields of `StoreInner<T>` should all get
        // dropped, and the manual management of destructors is basically
        // between this method and `Drop for Store<T>`. Note that this also

Wasmtime caught a segfault for a wasm program because the faulting instruction
is allowed to segfault due to how linear memories are implemented. The address
that was accessed, however, is not known to any linear memory in use within this

because all addresses which are known to be reachable from wasm won't reach this

shouldn't have been able to. Other accesses may have succeeded and this one just
happened to be caught. The process will now be aborted to prevent this damage
from going any further and to alert what's going on. If this is a security
issue please reach out to the Wasmtime team via its security policy

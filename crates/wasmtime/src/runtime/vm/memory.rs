//! Memory management for linear memories.
//!
//! This module implements the runtime data structures that manage linear
//! memories for WebAssembly. There's a number of types here each with various
//! purposes, and this is the high level relationships between types where an
//! arrow here means "builds on top of".

//!
//! In more detail:
//!
//! * `Memory` - the root of what's actually stored in a wasm instance. This
//!   implements the high-level embedder APIs one would expect from a wasm
//!   linear memory.
//!
//! * `SharedMemory` - this is one of the variants of a local memory. A shared
//!   memory contains `RwLock<LocalMemory>` where all the real bits happen
//!   within the lock.
//!
//! * `LocalMemory` - this is an owned allocation of a linear memory which
//!   maintains low-level state that's shared between `SharedMemory` and the
//!   instance-local state of `Memory`. One example is that `LocalMemory::grow`
//!   has most of the logic around memory growth.
//!
//! * `RuntimeLinearMemory` - this is a trait which `LocalMemory` delegates to.
//!   This trait is intentionally relatively simple to be exposed in Wasmtime's
//!   embedder API. This is exposed all the way through `wasmtime::Config` so
//!   embedders can provide arbitrary implementations.
//!
//! * `MmapMemory` - this is an implementation of `RuntimeLinearMemory` in terms
//!   of the platform's mmap primitive.
//!
//! * `StaticMemory` - this is an implementation of `RuntimeLinearMemory`
//!   for the pooling allocator where the base pointer is already allocated
//!   and contents are managed through `MemoryImageSlot`.
//!
//! Other important types for memories are `MemoryImage` and `MemoryImageSlot`
//! which manage CoW state for memories. This is implemented at the
//! `LocalMemory` layer.
//!
//! FIXME: don't have both RuntimeLinearMemory and wasmtime::LinearMemory, they
//! should be merged together.
//!
//! FIXME: don't have both RuntimeMemoryCreator and wasmtime::MemoryCreator,
//! they should be merged together.

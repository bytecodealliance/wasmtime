///
/// * [`AlignedLength`]: Both the start address and length are page-aligned
/// (i.e. a multiple of the host page size). This is always the result of an
/// mmap backed by anonymous memory.

/// * [`UnalignedLength`]: The start address is host page-aligned, but the
/// length is not necessarily page-aligned. This is usually backed by a file,
/// but can also be backed by anonymous memory.

/// ## Notes
///
/// If the length of a file is not a multiple of the host page size, [POSIX does
/// not specify any semantics][posix-mmap] for the rest of the last page. Linux
/// [does say][linux-mmap] that the rest of the page is reserved and zeroed out,
/// but for portability it's best to not assume anything about the rest of
/// memory. `UnalignedLength` achieves a type-level distinction between an mmap
/// that is backed purely by memory, and one that is possibly backed by a file.
///
/// Currently, the OS-specific `mmap` implementations in this crate do not make
/// this this distinction -- alignment is managed at this platform-independent
/// layer. It might make sense to add this distinction to the OS-specific
/// implementations in the future.

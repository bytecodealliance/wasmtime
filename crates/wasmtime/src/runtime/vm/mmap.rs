///
/// If the length of a file is not a multiple of the host page size, [POSIX does
/// not specify any semantics][posix-mmap] for the rest of the last page. Linux
/// [does say][linux-mmap] that the rest of the page is reserved and zeroed out,

/// that is backed purely by memory, and one that is possibly backed by a file.

/// Currently, the OS-specific `mmap` implementations in this crate do not make
/// this this distinction -- alignment is managed at this platform-independent

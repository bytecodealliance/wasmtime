//! OS-related abstractions required by Wasmtime.

//! This module is intended to house all logic that's specific to either Unix
//! or Windows, for example. The goal of this module is to be the "single
//! module" to edit if Wasmtime is ported to a new platform. Ideally all that's
//! needed is an extra block below and a new platform should be good to go after
//! filling out the implementation.

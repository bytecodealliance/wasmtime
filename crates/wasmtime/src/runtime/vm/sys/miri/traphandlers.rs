// For MIRI, there's no way to implement longjmp/setjmp. The only possible way
// to implement this is with panic/catch_panic, but the entrypoint into Rust
// from wasm is defined as `extern "C"` which isn't allowed to panic. That
// means that panicking here triggers UB which gets routed to `libc::abort()`.
//
// This maens that on MIRI all tests which trap are configured to be skipped at
// this time.
//
// Note that no actual JIT code runs in MIRI so this is purely here for
// host-to-host calls.

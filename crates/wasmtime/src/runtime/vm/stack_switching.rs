/// This type represents a linked lists ("chain") of stacks, where the a

/// Additionally, a `CommonStackInformation` object is associated with
/// each stack in the list.
/// Here, a "stack" is one of the following:
/// - A continuation (i.e., created with cont.new).
/// - The initial stack. This is the stack that we were on when entering
///   Wasm (i.e., when executing
///   `crate::runtime::func::invoke_wasm_and_catch_traps`).
///   This stack never has a parent.
///   In terms of the memory allocation that this stack resides on, it will
///   usually be the main stack, but doesn't have to: If we are running
///   inside a continuation while executing a host call, which in turn
///   re-renters Wasm, the initial stack is actually the stack of that
///   continuation.
///
/// Note that the linked list character of `VMStackChain` arises from the fact
/// that `VMStackChain::Continuation` variants have a pointer to a
/// `VMContRef`, which in turn has a `parent_chain` value of type
/// `VMStackChain`. This is how the stack chain reflects the parent-child
/// relationships between continuations/stacks. This also shows how the
/// initial stack (mentioned above) cannot have a parent.
///
/// There are generally two uses of `VMStackChain`:
///
/// 1. The `stack_chain` field in the `StoreOpaque` contains such a
/// chain of stacks, where the head of the list denotes the stack that is
/// currently executing (either a continuation or the initial stack). Note
/// that in this case, the linked list must contain 0 or more `Continuation`
/// elements, followed by a final `InitialStack` element. In particular,
/// this list always ends with `InitialStack` and never contains an `Absent`
/// variant.
///
/// 2. When a continuation is suspended, its chain of parents eventually
/// ends with an `Absent` variant in its `parent_chain` field. Note that a
/// suspended continuation never appears in the stack chain in the
/// VMContext!
///
///
/// As mentioned before, each stack in a `VMStackChain` has a corresponding
/// `CommonStackInformation` object. For continuations, this is stored in
/// the `common_stack_information` field of the corresponding `VMContRef`.
/// For the initial stack, the `InitialStack` variant contains a pointer to
/// a `CommonStackInformation`. The latter will be allocated allocated on
/// the stack frame that executed by `invoke_wasm_and_catch_traps`.
///
/// The following invariants hold for these `VMStackLimits` objects,
/// and the data in `VMStoreContext`.
///
/// Currently executing stack: For the currently executing stack (i.e., the
/// stack that is at the head of the store's `stack_chain` list), the
/// associated `VMStackLimits` object contains stale/undefined data. Instead,
/// the live data describing the limits for the currently executing stack is
/// always maintained in `VMStoreContext`. Note that as a general rule
/// independently from any execution of continuations, the `last_wasm_exit*`
/// fields in the `VMStoreContext` contain undefined values while executing
/// wasm.
///
/// Parents of currently executing stack: For stacks that appear in the tail
/// of the store's `stack_chain` list (i.e., stacks that are not currently
/// executing themselves, but are an ancestor of the currently executing
/// stack), we have the following: All the fields in the stack's
/// `VMStackLimits` are valid, describing the stack's stack limit, and
/// pointers where executing for that stack entered and exited WASM.
///
/// Suspended continuations: For suspended continuations (including their
/// ancestors), we have the following. Note that the initial stack can never
/// be in this state. The `stack_limit` and `last_enter_wasm_sp` fields of
/// the corresponding `VMStackLimits` object contain valid data, while the
/// `last_exit_wasm_*` fields contain arbitrary values. There is only one
/// exception to this: Note that a continuation that has been created with
/// cont.new, but never been resumed so far, is considered "suspended".
/// However, its `last_enter_wasm_sp` field contains undefined data. This is
/// justified, because when resume-ing a continuation for the first time, a
/// native-to-wasm trampoline is called, which sets up the
/// `last_wasm_entry_sp` in the `VMStoreContext` with the correct value,
/// thus restoring the necessary invariant.

use wasmtime_asm_macros::asm_func;

// This is a pretty special function that has no real signature. Its use is to
// be the "base" function of all fibers. This entrypoint is used in
// `wasmtime_continuation_init` to bootstrap the execution of a new fiber.
//
// We also use this function as a persistent frame on the stack to emit dwarf
// information to unwind into the caller. This allows us to unwind from the
// fiber's stack back to the initial stack that the fiber was called from. We use
// special dwarf directives here to do so since this is a pretty nonstandard
// function.
//
// If you're curious a decent introduction to CFI things and unwinding is at
// https://www.imperialviolet.org/2017/01/18/cfi.html
//
// Note that this function is never called directly. It is only ever entered
// when a `stack_switch` instruction loads its address when switching to a stack
// prepared by `FiberStack::initialize`.
//
// Executing `stack_switch` on a stack prepared by `FiberStack::initialize` as
// described in the comment on `FiberStack::initialize` leads to the following
// values in various registers when execution of wasmtime_continuation_start begins:
//
// RSP: TOS - 0x40 - (16 * `args_capacity`)
// RBP: TOS - 0x10

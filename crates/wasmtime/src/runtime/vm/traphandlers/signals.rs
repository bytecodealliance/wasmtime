//! Trap handling support when `feature = "signals-based-traps"` is enabled.
//!
//! This module is conditionally included in the above `traphandlers` module and
//! contains support and shared routines for working with signals-based traps.
//! Each platform will have its own `signals-based-traps` configuration and
//! thise module serves as a shared entrypoint for initialization entrypoints
//! (`init_traps`) and testing if a trapping opcode is wasm (`test_if_trap`).

///
/// This state is protected by a lock to synchronize access to it. Right now
/// it's a `RwLock` but it could be a `Mutex`, and `RwLock` is just chosen for
/// convenience as it's what's implemented in no_std. The performance here
/// should not be of consequence.

/// This will configure global state such as signal handlers to prepare the
/// process to receive wasm traps.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// This function will panic on macOS if it is called twice or more times with
/// different values of `macos_use_mach_ports`.
///
/// This function will also panic if the `std` feature is disabled and it's
/// called concurrently.

/// installed their own signal handlers after `init_traps` was called.

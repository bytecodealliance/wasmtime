//! Backtrace and stack walking functionality for Wasm.
//!
//! Walking the Wasm stack is comprised of
//!
//! 1. identifying sequences of contiguous Wasm frames on the stack
//!    (i.e. skipping over native host frames), and
//!
//! 2. walking the Wasm frames within such a sequence.
//!
//! To perform (1) we maintain the entry stack pointer (SP) and exit frame
//! pointer (FP) and program counter (PC) each time we call into Wasm and Wasm
//! calls into the host via trampolines (see
//! `crates/wasmtime/src/runtime/vm/trampolines`). The most recent entry is
//! stored in `VMRuntimeLimits` and older entries are saved in
//! `CallThreadState`. This lets us identify ranges of contiguous Wasm frames on
//! the stack.
//!
//! To solve (2) and walk the Wasm frames within a region of contiguous Wasm
//! frames on the stack, we configure Cranelift's `preserve_frame_pointers =
//! true` setting. Then we can do simple frame pointer traversal starting at the
//! exit FP and stopping once we reach the entry SP (meaning that the next older
//! frame is a host frame).

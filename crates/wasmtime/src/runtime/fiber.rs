// This is surely the most dangerous `unsafe impl Send` in the entire

// manage `Suspend` when resuming, and requires raw pointers to get it to happen
// easily.  Nothing too weird about the `Send`-ness, values aren't actually
// crossing threads.
//
// The really interesting piece is `fiber`. Now the "fiber" here is actual
// honest-to-god Rust code which we're moving around. What we're doing is the
// equivalent of moving our thread's stack to another OS thread. Turns out we,
// in general, have no idea what's on the stack and would generally have no way
// to verify that this is actually safe to do!
//
// Thankfully, though, Wasmtime has the power. Without being glib it's actually
// worth examining what's on the stack. It's unfortunately not super-local to
// this function itself. Our closure to `Fiber::new` runs `func`, which is given
// to us from the outside. Thankfully, though, we have tight control over
// this. Usage of `on_fiber` or `Instance::resume_fiber` is typically done
// *just* before entering WebAssembly itself, so we'll have a few stack frames
// of Rust code (all in Wasmtime itself) before we enter wasm.
//
// Once we've entered wasm, well then we have a whole bunch of wasm frames on
// the stack. We've got this nifty thing called Cranelift, though, which allows
// us to also have complete control over everything on the stack!
//
// Finally, when wasm switches back to the fiber's starting pointer (this future
// we're returning) then it means wasm has reentered Rust.  Suspension can only
// happen via either `block_on` or `Instance::suspend`. This, conveniently, also
// happens entirely in Wasmtime controlled code!
//
// There's an extremely important point that should be called out here.
// User-provided futures **are not on the stack** during suspension points. This
// is extremely crucial because we in general cannot reason about Send/Sync for
// stack-local variables since rustc doesn't analyze them at all. With our
// construction, though, we are guaranteed that Wasmtime owns all stack frames
// between the stack of a fiber and when the fiber suspends (and it could move
// across threads). At this time the only user-provided piece of data on the
// stack is the future itself given to us. Lo-and-behold as you might notice the
// future is required to be `Send`!
//
// What this all boils down to is that we, as the authors of Wasmtime, need to
// be extremely careful that on the async fiber stack we only store Send
// things. For example we can't start using `Rc` willy nilly by accident and
// leave a copy in TLS somewhere. (similarly we have to be ready for TLS to
// change while we're executing wasm code between suspension points).
//

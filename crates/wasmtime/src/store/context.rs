/// this trait provide access to a [`StoreContextMut`] via some means, allowing

///
/// This is notably used for methods that may require some mutation of the
/// [`Store`] itself. For example calling a wasm function can mutate linear
/// memory or globals. Creation of a [`Func`](crate::Func) will update internal
/// data structures. This ends up being quite a common bound in Wasmtime, but
/// typically you can simply pass `&mut store` or `&mut caller` to satisfy it.
///
/// # Calling multiple methods that take `&mut impl AsContextMut`
///
/// As of Rust 1.53.0, [generic methods that take a generic `&mut T` do not get
/// "automatic reborrowing"][reborrowing] and therefore you cannot call multiple
/// generic methods with the same `&mut T` without manually inserting
/// reborrows. This affects the many `wasmtime` API methods that take `&mut impl
/// AsContextMut`.
///
/// For example, this fails to compile because the context is moved into the
/// first call:
///
/// ```compile_fail
/// use wasmtime::{AsContextMut, Instance};
///
/// fn foo(cx: &mut impl AsContextMut, instance: Instance) {
///     // `cx` is not reborrowed, but moved into this call.
///     let my_export = instance.get_export(cx, "my_export");
///
///     // Therefore, this use of `cx` is a use-after-move and prohibited by the
///     // borrow checker.
///     let other_export = instance.get_export(cx, "other_export");
/// #   drop((my_export, other_export));
/// }
/// ```
///
/// To fix this, manually insert reborrows like `&mut *cx` that would otherwise
/// normally be inserted automatically by the Rust compiler for non-generic
/// methods:
///
/// ```
/// use wasmtime::{AsContextMut, Instance};
///
/// fn foo(cx: &mut impl AsContextMut, instance: Instance) {
///     let my_export = instance.get_export(&mut *cx, "my_export");
///
///     // This works now, since `cx` was reborrowed above, rather than moved!
///     let other_export = instance.get_export(&mut *cx, "other_export");
/// #   drop((my_export, other_export));
/// }
/// ```

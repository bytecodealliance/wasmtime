    ///
    /// Linear memories represent contiguous arrays of bytes, but they can also

    /// space hasn't been preallocated then growth may involve relocating the
    /// base pointer in memory. Memories in Wasmtime are classified in two
    /// different ways:
    ///
    /// * **static** - these memories preallocate all space necessary they'll
    ///   ever need, meaning that the base pointer of these memories is never
    ///   moved. Static memories may take more virtual memory space because of
    ///   pre-reserving space for memories.
    ///
    /// * **dynamic** - these memories are not preallocated and may move during
    ///   growth operations. Dynamic memories consume less virtual memory space
    ///   because they don't need to preallocate space for future growth.
    ///
    /// Static memories can be optimized better in JIT code because once the
    /// base address is loaded in a function it's known that we never need to
    /// reload it because it never changes, `memory.grow` is generally a pretty
    /// fast operation because the wasm memory is never relocated, and under
    /// some conditions bounds checks can be elided on memory accesses.
    ///
    /// Dynamic memories can't be quite as heavily optimized because the base
    /// address may need to be reloaded more often, they may require relocating
    /// lots of data on `memory.grow`, and dynamic memories require
    /// unconditional bounds checks on all memory accesses.
    ///
    /// ## Should you use static or dynamic memory?
    ///
    /// In general you probably don't need to change the value of this property.
    /// The defaults here are optimized for each target platform to consume a
    /// reasonable amount of physical memory while also generating speedy
    /// machine code.
    ///
    /// One of the main reasons you may want to configure this today is if your
    /// environment can't reserve virtual memory space for each wasm linear
    /// memory. On 64-bit platforms wasm memories require a 6GB reservation by
    /// default, and system limits may prevent this in some scenarios. In this
    /// case you may wish to force memories to be allocated dynamically meaning
    /// that the virtual memory footprint of creating a wasm memory should be
    /// exactly what's used by the wasm itself.
    ///
    /// For 32-bit memories a static memory must contain at least 4GB of
    /// reserved address space plus a guard page to elide any bounds checks at
    /// all. Smaller static memories will use similar bounds checks as dynamic
    /// memories.
    ///
    /// ## Default
    ///
    /// The default value for this property depends on the host platform. For

    /// Wasmtime supports "asynchronous configs" which enables calling these
    /// asynchronous functions in a way that looks synchronous to the executing
    /// WebAssembly code.
    ///
    /// An asynchronous config must always invoke wasm code asynchronously,
    /// meaning we'll always represent its computation as a

    /// returned by Wasmtime will perform the actual work of calling the
    /// WebAssembly. Wasmtime won't manage its own thread pools or similar,
    /// that's left up to the embedder.

    /// To implement futures in a way that WebAssembly sees asynchronous host
    /// functions as synchronous, all async Wasmtime futures will execute on a
    /// separately allocated native stack from the thread otherwise executing
    /// Wasmtime. This separate native stack can then be switched to and from.
    /// Using this whenever an `async` host function returns a future that
    /// resolves to `Pending` we switch away from the temporary stack back to
    /// the main stack and propagate the `Pending` status.
    ///
    /// In general it's encouraged that the integration with `async` and
    /// wasmtime is designed early on in your embedding of Wasmtime to ensure
    /// that it's planned that WebAssembly executes in the right context of your
    /// application.
    ///
    /// # Execution in `poll`
    ///
    /// The [`Future::poll`](std::future::Future::poll) method is the main
    /// driving force behind Rust's futures. That method's own documentation
    /// states "an implementation of `poll` should strive to return quickly, and
    /// should not block". This, however, can be at odds with executing
    /// WebAssembly code as part of the `poll` method itself. If your
    /// WebAssembly is untrusted then this could allow the `poll` method to take
    /// arbitrarily long in the worst case, likely blocking all other
    /// asynchronous tasks.
    ///
    /// To remedy this situation you have a a few possible ways to solve this:
    ///
    /// * The most efficient solution is to enable
    ///   [`Config::epoch_interruption`] in conjunction with
    ///   [`crate::Store::epoch_deadline_async_yield_and_update`]. Coupled with
    ///   periodic calls to [`crate::Engine::increment_epoch`] this will cause
    ///   executing WebAssembly to periodically yield back according to the
    ///   epoch configuration settings. This enables `Future::poll` to take at
    ///   most a certain amount of time according to epoch configuration
    ///   settings and when increments happen. The benefit of this approach is
    ///   that the instrumentation in compiled code is quite lightweight, but a
    ///   downside can be that the scheduling is somewhat nondeterministic since
    ///   increments are usually timer-based which are not always deterministic.
    ///
    ///   Note that to prevent infinite execution of wasm it's recommended to
    ///   place a timeout on the entire future representing executing wasm code
    ///   and the periodic yields with epochs should ensure that when the
    ///   timeout is reached it's appropriately recognized.
    ///
    /// * Alternatively you can enable the
    ///   [`Config::consume_fuel`](crate::Config::consume_fuel) method as well
    ///   as [`crate::Store::fuel_async_yield_interval`] When doing so this will
    ///   configure Wasmtime futures to yield periodically while they're
    ///   executing WebAssembly code. After consuming the specified amount of
    ///   fuel wasm futures will return `Poll::Pending` from their `poll`
    ///   method, and will get automatically re-polled later. This enables the
    ///   `Future::poll` method to take roughly a fixed amount of time since
    ///   fuel is guaranteed to get consumed while wasm is executing. Unlike
    ///   epoch-based preemption this is deterministic since wasm always
    ///   consumes a fixed amount of fuel per-operation. The downside of this
    ///   approach, however, is that the compiled code instrumentation is
    ///   significantly more expensive than epoch checks.
    ///
    ///   Note that to prevent infinite execution of wasm it's recommended to
    ///   place a timeout on the entire future representing executing wasm code
    ///   and the periodic yields with epochs should ensure that when the

    /// [`Engine`](crate::Engine) and can be incremented by calling
    /// [`Engine::increment_epoch`](crate::Engine::increment_epoch).
    /// Epoch-based instrumentation works by setting a "deadline
    /// epoch". The compiled code knows the deadline, and at certain
    /// points, checks the current epoch against that deadline. It
    /// will yield if the deadline has been reached.
    ///
    /// The idea is that checking an infrequently-changing counter is
    /// cheaper than counting and frequently storing a precise metric
    /// (instructions executed) locally. The interruptions are not
    /// deterministic, but if the embedder increments the epoch in a
    /// periodic way (say, every regular timer tick by a thread or
    /// signal handler), then we can ensure that all async code will
    /// yield to the executor within a bounded time.
    ///
    /// The deadline check cannot be avoided by malicious wasm code. It is safe
    /// to use epoch deadlines to limit the execution time of untrusted
    /// code.

    /// what happens when the deadline is reached during

    ///
    /// - Trap if code is executing when the epoch deadline is
    ///   met. See
    ///   [`Store::epoch_deadline_trap`](crate::Store::epoch_deadline_trap).
    ///
    /// - Call an arbitrary function. This function may chose to trap or
    ///   increment the epoch. See
    ///   [`Store::epoch_deadline_callback`](crate::Store::epoch_deadline_callback).
    ///
    /// - Yield to the executor loop, then resume when the future is
    ///   next polled. See
    ///   [`Store::epoch_deadline_async_yield_and_update`](crate::Store::epoch_deadline_async_yield_and_update).
    ///
    /// Trapping is the default. The yielding behaviour may be used for
    /// the timeslicing behavior described above.
    ///
    /// This feature is available with or without async support.
    /// However, without async support, the timeslicing behaviour is
    /// not available. This means epoch-based interruption can only
    /// serve as a simple external-interruption mechanism.
    ///
    /// An initial deadline must be set before executing code by calling
    /// [`Store::set_epoch_deadline`](crate::Store::set_epoch_deadline). If this
    /// deadline is not configured then wasm will immediately trap.
    ///
    /// ## When to use fuel vs. epochs
    ///
    /// In general, epoch-based interruption results in faster
    /// execution. This difference is sometimes significant: in some
    /// measurements, up to 2-3x. This is because epoch-based
    /// interruption does less work: it only watches for a global
    /// rarely-changing counter to increment, rather than keeping a
    /// local frequently-changing counter and comparing it to a
    /// deadline.
    ///
    /// Fuel, in contrast, should be used when *deterministic*
    /// yielding or trapping is needed. For example, if it is required
    /// that the same function call with the same starting state will
    /// always either complete or trap with an out-of-fuel error,

    /// - Assuming the same conditions, but this time wasm code does not consume
    ///   any stack but calls into a host function. The host function consumes
    ///   more than 512 KiB of stack space. The process will be aborted.
    ///
    /// There's another gotcha related to recursive calling into wasm: the stack
    /// space consumed by a host function is counted towards this limit. The
    /// host functions are not prevented from consuming more than this limit.
    /// However, if the host function that used more than this limit and called
    /// back into wasm, then the execution will trap immediately because of

    /// ## Static vs Dynamic Memory
    ///
    /// Linear memories represent contiguous arrays of bytes, but they can also

    /// base pointer in memory. Memories in Wasmtime are classified in two

    ///
    /// * **static** - these memories preallocate all space necessary they'll
    ///   ever need, meaning that the base pointer of these memories is never
    ///   moved. Static memories may take more virtual memory space because of
    ///   pre-reserving space for memories.
    ///
    /// * **dynamic** - these memories are not preallocated and may move during
    ///   growth operations. Dynamic memories consume less virtual memory space
    ///   because they don't need to preallocate space for future growth.
    ///
    /// Static memories can be optimized better in JIT code because once the
    /// base address is loaded in a function it's known that we never need to
    /// reload it because it never changes, `memory.grow` is generally a pretty
    /// fast operation because the wasm memory is never relocated, and under
    /// some conditions bounds checks can be elided on memory accesses.
    ///
    /// Dynamic memories can't be quite as heavily optimized because the base
    /// address may need to be reloaded more often, they may require relocating
    /// lots of data on `memory.grow`, and dynamic memories require
    /// unconditional bounds checks on all memory accesses.
    ///
    /// ## Should you use static or dynamic memory?
    ///
    /// In general you probably don't need to change the value of this property.
    /// The defaults here are optimized for each target platform to consume a
    /// reasonable amount of physical memory while also generating speedy
    /// machine code.
    ///
    /// One of the main reasons you may want to configure this today is if your
    /// environment can't reserve virtual memory space for each wasm linear
    /// memory. On 64-bit platforms wasm memories require a 6GB reservation by
    /// default, and system limits may prevent this in some scenarios. In this
    /// case you may wish to force memories to be allocated dynamically meaning
    /// that the virtual memory footprint of creating a wasm memory should be
    /// exactly what's used by the wasm itself.
    ///
    /// For 32-bit memories a static memory must contain at least 4GB of
    /// reserved address space plus a guard page to elide any bounds checks at
    /// all. Smaller static memories will use similar bounds checks as dynamic
    /// memories.
    ///
    /// ## Default
    ///
    /// The default value for this property depends on the host platform. For
    /// 64-bit platforms there's lots of address space available, so the default
    /// configured here is 4GB. WebAssembly linear memories currently max out at
    /// 4GB which means that on 64-bit platforms Wasmtime by default always uses
    /// a static memory. This, coupled with a sufficiently sized guard region,
    /// should produce the fastest JIT code on 64-bit platforms, but does
    /// require a large address space reservation for each wasm memory.

/// Configuration options used with [`InstanceAllocationStrategy::Pooling`] to

///
/// Note that usage of the pooling allocator does not affect compiled
/// WebAssembly code. Compiled `*.cwasm` files, for example, are usable both
/// with and without the pooling allocator.
///
/// ## Advantages of Pooled Allocation
///
/// The main benefit of the pooling allocator is to make WebAssembly
/// instantiation both faster and more scalable in terms of parallelism.
/// Allocation is faster because virtual memory is already configured and ready
/// to go within the pool, there's no need to [`mmap`] (for example on Unix) a
/// new region and configure it with guard pages. By avoiding [`mmap`] this
/// avoids whole-process virtual memory locks which can improve scalability and
/// performance through avoiding this.
///
/// Additionally with pooled allocation it's possible to create "affine slots"
/// to a particular WebAssembly module or component over time. For example if
/// the same module is multiple times over time the pooling allocator will, by
/// default, attempt to reuse the same slot. This mean that the slot has been
/// pre-configured and can retain virtual memory mappings for a copy-on-write
/// image, for example (see [`Config::memory_init_cow`] for more information.
/// This means that in a steady state instance deallocation is a single
/// [`madvise`] to reset linear memory to its original contents followed by a
/// single (optional) [`mprotect`] during the next instantiation to shrink
/// memory back to its original size. Compared to non-pooled allocation this
/// avoids the need to [`mmap`] a new region of memory, [`munmap`] it, and
/// [`mprotect`] regions too.
///
/// Another benefit of pooled allocation is that it's possible to configure
/// things such that no virtual memory management is required at all in a steady
/// state. For example a pooling allocator can be configured with
/// [`Config::memory_init_cow`] disabledd, dynamic bounds checks enabled
/// through
/// [`Config::static_memory_maximum_size(0)`](Config::static_memory_maximum_size),
/// and sufficient space through
/// [`PoolingAllocationConfig::table_keep_resident`] /
/// [`PoolingAllocationConfig::linear_memory_keep_resident`]. With all these
/// options in place no virtual memory tricks are used at all and everything is
/// manually managed by Wasmtime (for example resetting memory is a
/// `memset(0)`). This is not as fast in a single-threaded scenario but can
/// provide benefits in high-parallelism situations as no virtual memory locks
/// or IPIs need happen.
///
/// ## Disadvantages of Pooled Allocation
///
/// Despite the above advantages to instantiation performance the pooling
/// allocator is not enabled by default in Wasmtime. One reason is that the
/// performance advantages are not necessarily portable, for example while the
/// pooling allocator works on Windows it has not been tuned for performance on
/// Windows in the same way it has on Linux.
///
/// Additionally the main cost of the pooling allocator is that it requires a
/// very large reservation of virtual memory (on the order of most of the
/// addressable virtual address space). WebAssembly 32-bit linear memories in
/// Wasmtime are, by default 4G address space reservations with a 2G guard
/// region both before and after the linear memory. Memories in the pooling
/// allocator are contiguous which means that we only need a guard after linear
/// memory because the previous linear memory's slot post-guard is our own
/// pre-guard. This means that, by default, the pooling allocator uses 6G of
/// virtual memory per WebAssembly linear memory slot. 6G of virtual memory is
/// 32.5 bits of a 64-bit address. Many 64-bit systems can only actually use
/// 48-bit addresses by default (although this can be extended on architectures
/// nowadays too), and of those 48 bits one of them is reserved to indicate
/// kernel-vs-userspace. This leaves 47-32.5=14.5 bits left, meaning you can
/// only have at most 64k slots of linear memories on many systems by default.
/// This is a relatively small number and shows how the pooling allocator can
/// quickly exhaust all of virtual memory.
///
/// Another disadvantage of the pooling allocator is that it may keep memory
/// alive when nothing is using it. A previously used slot for an instance might
/// have paged-in memory that will not get paged out until the
/// [`Engine`](crate::Engine) owning the pooling allocator is dropped. While
/// suitable for some applications this behavior may not be suitable for all
/// applications.
///
/// Finally the last disadvantage of the pooling allocator is that the
/// configuration values for the maximum number of instances, memories, tables,
/// etc, must all be fixed up-front. There's not always a clear answer as to
/// what these values should be so not all applications may be able to work
/// with this constraint.

    /// WebAssembly code.

    /// separately allocated native stack from the thread otherwise executing
    /// Wasmtime. This separate native stack can then be switched to and from.
    /// Using this whenever an `async` host function returns a future that
    /// resolves to `Pending` we switch away from the temporary stack back to
    /// the main stack and propagate the `Pending` status.
    ///
    /// In general it's encouraged that the integration with `async` and
    /// wasmtime is designed early on in your embedding of Wasmtime to ensure
    /// that it's planned that WebAssembly executes in the right context of your
    /// application.
    ///
    /// # Execution in `poll`
    ///
    /// The [`Future::poll`](std::future::Future::poll) method is the main
    /// driving force behind Rust's futures. That method's own documentation
    /// states "an implementation of `poll` should strive to return quickly, and
    /// should not block". This, however, can be at odds with executing
    /// WebAssembly code as part of the `poll` method itself. If your
    /// WebAssembly is untrusted then this could allow the `poll` method to take
    /// arbitrarily long in the worst case, likely blocking all other
    /// asynchronous tasks.
    ///
    /// To remedy this situation you have a a few possible ways to solve this:
    ///
    /// * The most efficient solution is to enable
    ///   [`Config::epoch_interruption`] in conjunction with
    ///   [`crate::Store::epoch_deadline_async_yield_and_update`]. Coupled with
    ///   periodic calls to [`crate::Engine::increment_epoch`] this will cause
    ///   executing WebAssembly to periodically yield back according to the
    ///   epoch configuration settings. This enables `Future::poll` to take at
    ///   most a certain amount of time according to epoch configuration
    ///   settings and when increments happen. The benefit of this approach is
    ///   that the instrumentation in compiled code is quite lightweight, but a
    ///   downside can be that the scheduling is somewhat nondeterministic since
    ///   increments are usually timer-based which are not always deterministic.
    ///
    ///   Note that to prevent infinite execution of wasm it's recommended to
    ///   place a timeout on the entire future representing executing wasm code
    ///   and the periodic yields with epochs should ensure that when the
    ///   timeout is reached it's appropriately recognized.
    ///
    /// * Alternatively you can enable the
    ///   [`Config::consume_fuel`](crate::Config::consume_fuel) method as well
    ///   as [`crate::Store::fuel_async_yield_interval`] When doing so this will
    ///   configure Wasmtime futures to yield periodically while they're
    ///   executing WebAssembly code. After consuming the specified amount of
    ///   fuel wasm futures will return `Poll::Pending` from their `poll`
    ///   method, and will get automatically re-polled later. This enables the
    ///   `Future::poll` method to take roughly a fixed amount of time since
    ///   fuel is guaranteed to get consumed while wasm is executing. Unlike
    ///   epoch-based preemption this is deterministic since wasm always
    ///   consumes a fixed amount of fuel per-operation. The downside of this
    ///   approach, however, is that the compiled code instrumentation is
    ///   significantly more expensive than epoch checks.
    ///

    ///   place a timeout on the entire future representing executing wasm code

    /// When executing code in async mode, we sometimes want to

    /// guest code should periodically yield to the executor
    /// loop. This yielding could be implemented by using "fuel" (see

    /// instrumentation is somewhat expensive: it modifies the
    /// compiled form of the Wasm code so that it maintains a precise
    /// instruction count, frequently checking this count against the
    /// remaining fuel. If one does not need this precise count or
    /// deterministic interruptions, and only needs a periodic
    /// interrupt of some form, then It would be better to have a more
    /// lightweight mechanism.
    ///
    /// Epoch-based interruption is that mechanism. There is a global
    /// "epoch", which is a counter that divides time into arbitrary
    /// periods (or epochs). This counter lives on the
    /// [`Engine`](crate::Engine) and can be incremented by calling
    /// [`Engine::increment_epoch`](crate::Engine::increment_epoch).
    /// Epoch-based instrumentation works by setting a "deadline
    /// epoch". The compiled code knows the deadline, and at certain
    /// points, checks the current epoch against that deadline. It
    /// will yield if the deadline has been reached.
    ///
    /// The idea is that checking an infrequently-changing counter is
    /// cheaper than counting and frequently storing a precise metric
    /// (instructions executed) locally. The interruptions are not
    /// deterministic, but if the embedder increments the epoch in a
    /// periodic way (say, every regular timer tick by a thread or
    /// signal handler), then we can ensure that all async code will
    /// yield to the executor within a bounded time.
    ///
    /// The deadline check cannot be avoided by malicious wasm code. It is safe
    /// to use epoch deadlines to limit the execution time of untrusted
    /// code.
    ///
    /// The [`Store`](crate::Store) tracks the deadline, and controls
    /// what happens when the deadline is reached during
    /// execution. Several behaviors are possible:
    ///
    /// - Trap if code is executing when the epoch deadline is
    ///   met. See
    ///   [`Store::epoch_deadline_trap`](crate::Store::epoch_deadline_trap).
    ///
    /// - Call an arbitrary function. This function may chose to trap or
    ///   increment the epoch. See
    ///   [`Store::epoch_deadline_callback`](crate::Store::epoch_deadline_callback).
    ///
    /// - Yield to the executor loop, then resume when the future is
    ///   next polled. See
    ///   [`Store::epoch_deadline_async_yield_and_update`](crate::Store::epoch_deadline_async_yield_and_update).
    ///
    /// Trapping is the default. The yielding behaviour may be used for
    /// the timeslicing behavior described above.
    ///
    /// This feature is available with or without async support.
    /// However, without async support, the timeslicing behaviour is
    /// not available. This means epoch-based interruption can only
    /// serve as a simple external-interruption mechanism.
    ///
    /// An initial deadline must be set before executing code by calling
    /// [`Store::set_epoch_deadline`](crate::Store::set_epoch_deadline). If this
    /// deadline is not configured then wasm will immediately trap.
    ///
    /// ## Interaction with blocking host calls
    ///
    /// Epochs (and fuel) do not assist in handling WebAssembly code blocked in
    /// a call to the host. For example if the WebAssembly function calls
    /// `wasi:io/poll/poll` to sleep epochs will not assist in waking this up or
    /// timing it out. Epochs intentionally only affect running WebAssembly code
    /// itself and it's left to the embedder to determine how best to wake up
    /// indefinitely blocking code in the host.
    ///
    /// The typical solution for this, however, is to use
    /// [`Config::async_support(true)`](Config::async_support) and the `async`
    /// variant of WASI host functions. This models computation as a Rust
    /// `Future` which means that when blocking happens the future is only
    /// suspended and control yields back to the main event loop. This gives the
    /// embedder the opportunity to use `tokio::time::timeout` for example on a
    /// wasm computation and have the desired effect of cancelling a blocking
    /// operation when a timeout expires.
    ///
    /// ## When to use fuel vs. epochs
    ///
    /// In general, epoch-based interruption results in faster
    /// execution. This difference is sometimes significant: in some
    /// measurements, up to 2-3x. This is because epoch-based
    /// interruption does less work: it only watches for a global
    /// rarely-changing counter to increment, rather than keeping a
    /// local frequently-changing counter and comparing it to a
    /// deadline.
    ///
    /// Fuel, in contrast, should be used when *deterministic*
    /// yielding or trapping is needed. For example, if it is required
    /// that the same function call with the same starting state will
    /// always either complete or trap with an out-of-fuel error,
    /// deterministically, then fuel with a fixed bound should be

    /// ## Background: WebAssembly Linear Memories
    ///
    /// WebAssembly linear memories always start with a minimum size and can
    /// possibly grow up to a maximum size. The minimum size is always specified
    /// in a WebAssembly module itself and the maximum size can either be
    /// optionally specified in the module or inherently limited by the index
    /// type. For example for this module:
    ///
    /// ```wasm
    /// (module
    ///     (memory $a 4)
    ///     (memory $b 4096 4096 (pagesize 1))
    ///     (memory $c i64 10)
    /// )
    /// ```
    ///
    /// * Memory `$a` initially allocates 4 WebAssembly pages (256KiB) and can
    ///   grow up to 4GiB, the limit of the 32-bit index space.
    /// * Memory `$b` initially allocates 4096 WebAssembly pages, but in this
    ///   case its page size is 1, so it's 4096 bytes. Memory can also grow no
    ///   further meaning that it will always be 4096 bytes.
    /// * Memory `$c` is a 64-bit linear memory which starts with 640KiB of
    ///   memory and can theoretically grow up to 2^64 bytes, although most
    ///   hosts will run out of memory long before that.
    ///
    /// All operations on linear memories done by wasm are required to be
    /// in-bounds. Any access beyond the end of a linear memory is considered a
    /// trap.
    ///
    /// ## What this setting affects: Virtual Memory
    ///
    /// This setting is used to configure the behavior of the size of the linear
    /// memory allocation performed for each of these memories. For example the
    /// initial linear memory allocation looks like this:
    ///
    /// ```text
    ///              memory_reservation
    ///                    |
    ///          ◄─────────┴────────────────►
    /// ┌───────┬─────────┬──────────────────┬───────┐
    /// │ guard │ initial │ ... capacity ... │ guard │
    /// └───────┴─────────┴──────────────────┴───────┘
    ///  ◄──┬──►                              ◄──┬──►
    ///     │                                    │
    ///     │                             memory_guard_size
    ///     │
    ///     │
    ///  memory_guard_size (if guard_before_linear_memory)
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Memory in the `initial` range is accessible to the instance and can be
    /// read/written by wasm code. Memory in the `guard` regions is never
    /// accesible to wasm code and memory in `capacity` is initially
    /// inaccessible but may become accesible through `memory.grow` instructions
    /// for example.
    ///
    /// This means that this setting is the size of the initial chunk of virtual
    /// memory that a linear memory may grow into.
    ///
    /// ## What this setting affects: Runtime Speed
    ///
    /// This is a performance-sensitive setting which is taken into account
    /// during the compilation process of a WebAssembly module. For example if a
    /// 32-bit WebAssembly linear memory has a `memory_reservation` size of 4GiB
    /// then bounds checks can be elided because `capacity` will be guaranteed
    /// to be unmapped for all addressible bytes that wasm can access (modulo a
    /// few details).
    ///
    /// If `memory_reservation` was something smaller like 256KiB then that
    /// would have a much smaller impact on virtual memory but the compile code
    /// would then need to have explicit bounds checks to ensure that
    /// loads/stores are in-bounds.
    ///
    /// The goal of this setting is to enable skipping bounds checks in most
    /// modules by default. Some situations which require explicit bounds checks
    /// though are:
    ///
    /// * When `memory_reservation` is smaller than the addressible size of the
    ///   linear memory. For example if 64-bit linear memories always need
    ///   bounds checks as they can address the entire virtual address spacce.
    ///   For 32-bit linear memories a `memory_reservation` minimum size of 4GiB
    ///   is required to elide bounds checks.
    ///
    /// * When linear memories have a page size of 1 then bounds checks are
    ///   required. In this situation virtual memory can't be relied upon
    ///   because that operates at the host page size granularity where wasm
    ///   requires a per-byte level granularity.
    ///
    /// * Configuration settings such as [`Config::signals_based_traps`] can be
    ///   used to disable the use of signal handlers and virtual memory so
    ///   explicit bounds checks are required.
    ///
    /// * When [`Config::memory_guard_size`] is too small a bounds check may be
    ///   required. For 32-bit wasm addresses are actually 33-bit effective
    ///   addresses because loads/stores have a 32-bit static offset to add to
    ///   the dynamic 32-bit address. If the static offset is larger than the
    ///   size of the guard region then an explicit bounds check is required.
    ///
    /// ## What this setting affects: Memory Growth Behavior
    ///
    /// In addition to affecting bounds checks emitted in compiled code this
    /// setting also affects how WebAssembly linear memories are grown. The
    /// `memory.grow` instruction can be used to make a linear memory larger and
    /// this is also affected by APIs such as
    /// [`Memory::grow`](crate::Memory::grow).
    ///
    /// In these situations when the amount being grown is small enough to fit
    /// within the remaining capacity then the linear memory doesn't have to be
    /// moved at runtime. If the capacity runs out though then a new linear
    /// memory allocation must be made and the contents of linear memory is
    /// copied over.
    ///
    /// For example here's a situation where a copy happens:
    ///
    /// * The `memory_reservation` setting is configured to 128KiB.
    /// * A WebAssembly linear memory starts with a single 64KiB page.
    /// * This memory can be grown by one page to contain the full 128KiB of
    ///   memory.
    /// * If grown by one more page, though, then a 192KiB allocation must be
    ///   made and the previous 128KiB of contents are copied into the new
    ///   allocation.
    ///
    /// This growth behavior can have a significant performance impact if lots
    /// of data needs to be copied on growth. Conversely if memory growth never
    /// needs to happen because the capacity will always be large enough then
    /// optimizations can be applied to cache the base pointer of linear memory.
    ///
    /// When memory is grown then the
    /// [`Config::memory_reservation_for_growth`] is used for the new
    /// memory allocation to have memory to grow into.
    ///
    /// When using the pooling allocator via [`PoolingAllocationConfig`] then
    /// memories are never allowed to move so requests for growth are instead
    /// rejected with an error.
    ///
    /// ## When this setting is not used
    ///
    /// This setting is ignored and unused when the initial size of linear
    /// memory is larger than this threshold. For example if this setting is set
    /// to 1MiB but a wasm module requires a 2MiB minimum allocation then this
    /// setting is ignored. In this situation the minimum size of memory will be
    /// allocated along with [`Config::memory_reservation_for_growth`]
    /// after it to grow into.
    ///
    /// That means that this value can be set to zero. That can be useful in
    /// benchmarking to see the overhead of bounds checks for example.
    /// Additionally it can be used to minimize the virtual memory allocated by
    /// Wasmtime.
    ///
    /// ## Default Value
    ///
    /// The default value for this property depends on the host platform. For
    /// 64-bit platforms there's lots of address space available, so the default
    /// configured here is 4GiB. When coupled with the default size of
    /// [`Config::memory_guard_size`] this means that 32-bit WebAssembly linear
    /// memories with 64KiB page sizes will skip almost all bounds checks by
    /// default.

/// Configuration options used with [`InstanceAllocationStrategy::Pooling`] to

///
/// Note that usage of the pooling allocator does not affect compiled
/// WebAssembly code. Compiled `*.cwasm` files, for example, are usable both
/// with and without the pooling allocator.
///
/// ## Advantages of Pooled Allocation
///
/// The main benefit of the pooling allocator is to make WebAssembly
/// instantiation both faster and more scalable in terms of parallelism.
/// Allocation is faster because virtual memory is already configured and ready
/// to go within the pool, there's no need to [`mmap`] (for example on Unix) a
/// new region and configure it with guard pages. By avoiding [`mmap`] this
/// avoids whole-process virtual memory locks which can improve scalability and
/// performance through avoiding this.
///
/// Additionally with pooled allocation it's possible to create "affine slots"
/// to a particular WebAssembly module or component over time. For example if
/// the same module is multiple times over time the pooling allocator will, by
/// default, attempt to reuse the same slot. This mean that the slot has been
/// pre-configured and can retain virtual memory mappings for a copy-on-write
/// image, for example (see [`Config::memory_init_cow`] for more information.
/// This means that in a steady state instance deallocation is a single
/// [`madvise`] to reset linear memory to its original contents followed by a
/// single (optional) [`mprotect`] during the next instantiation to shrink
/// memory back to its original size. Compared to non-pooled allocation this
/// avoids the need to [`mmap`] a new region of memory, [`munmap`] it, and
/// [`mprotect`] regions too.
///
/// Another benefit of pooled allocation is that it's possible to configure
/// things such that no virtual memory management is required at all in a steady
/// state. For example a pooling allocator can be configured with:
///
/// * [`Config::memory_init_cow`] disabled
/// * [`Config::memory_guard_size`] disabled
/// * [`Config::memory_reservation`] shrunk to minimal size
/// * [`PoolingAllocationConfig::table_keep_resident`] sufficiently large
/// * [`PoolingAllocationConfig::linear_memory_keep_resident`] sufficiently large
///
/// With all these options in place no virtual memory tricks are used at all and
/// everything is manually managed by Wasmtime (for example resetting memory is
/// a `memset(0)`). This is not as fast in a single-threaded scenario but can
/// provide benefits in high-parallelism situations as no virtual memory locks
/// or IPIs need happen.
///
/// ## Disadvantages of Pooled Allocation
///
/// Despite the above advantages to instantiation performance the pooling
/// allocator is not enabled by default in Wasmtime. One reason is that the
/// performance advantages are not necessarily portable, for example while the
/// pooling allocator works on Windows it has not been tuned for performance on
/// Windows in the same way it has on Linux.
///
/// Additionally the main cost of the pooling allocator is that it requires a
/// very large reservation of virtual memory (on the order of most of the
/// addressable virtual address space). WebAssembly 32-bit linear memories in
/// Wasmtime are, by default 4G address space reservations with a small guard
/// region both before and after the linear memory. Memories in the pooling
/// allocator are contiguous which means that we only need a guard after linear
/// memory because the previous linear memory's slot post-guard is our own
/// pre-guard. This means that, by default, the pooling allocator uses roughly
/// 4G of virtual memory per WebAssembly linear memory slot. 4G of virtual
/// memory is 32 bits of a 64-bit address. Many 64-bit systems can only
/// actually use 48-bit addresses by default (although this can be extended on
/// architectures nowadays too), and of those 48 bits one of them is reserved
/// to indicate kernel-vs-userspace. This leaves 47-32=15 bits left,
/// meaning you can only have at most 32k slots of linear memories on many
/// systems by default. This is a relatively small number and shows how the
/// pooling allocator can quickly exhaust all of virtual memory.
///
/// Another disadvantage of the pooling allocator is that it may keep memory
/// alive when nothing is using it. A previously used slot for an instance might
/// have paged-in memory that will not get paged out until the
/// [`Engine`](crate::Engine) owning the pooling allocator is dropped. While
/// suitable for some applications this behavior may not be suitable for all
/// applications.
///
/// Finally the last disadvantage of the pooling allocator is that the
/// configuration values for the maximum number of instances, memories, tables,
/// etc, must all be fixed up-front. There's not always a clear answer as to
/// what these values should be so not all applications may be able to work
/// with this constraint.

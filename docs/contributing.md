# Contributing

We're excited to work on Wasmtime and/or Cranelift together with you! This guide
should help you get up and running with Wasmtime and Cranelift development. But
first, make sure you've read the [Code of Conduct](./contributing-coc.html)!

Wasmtime and Cranelift are very ambitious projects with many goals, and while
we're confident we can achieve some of them, we see many opportunities for
people to get involved and help us achieve even more.

## Join Our Chat

We chat about Wasmtime and Cranelift development on Zulip &mdash; [join
us!](https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/). You can also join specific
streams:

* [#wasmtime](https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/217126-wasmtime)
* [#cranelift](https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/217117-cranelift)

If you're having trouble building Wasmtime or Cranelift, aren't sure why a test
is failing, or have any other questions, feel free to ask on Zulip. Not
everything we hope to do with these projects is reflected in the code or
documentation yet, so if you see things that seem missing or that don't make
sense, or even that just don't work the way you expect them to, we're also
interested to hear about that!

As always, you're more than welcome to [open an
issue](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/new) too!

## Finding Something to Hack On

If you're looking for something to do, these are great places to start:

* [Issues labeled "good first
  issue"](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/labels/good%20first%20issue)
  &mdash; these issues tend to be simple, what needs to be done is well known,
  and are good for new contributors to tackle. The goal is to learn Wasmtime's
  development workflow and make sure that you can build and test Wasmtime.

* [Issues labeled "help
  wanted"](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/labels/help%20wanted)
  &mdash; these are issues that we need a little help with!

If you're unsure if an issue is a good fit for you or not, feel free to ask in a
comment on the issue, or in chat.

### Mentoring

We're happy to mentor people, whether you're learning Rust, learning about
compiler backends, learning about machine code, learning about wasm, learning
about how Cranelift does things, or all together at once.

We categorize issues in the issue tracker using a tag scheme inspired by
[Rust's issue tags]. For example, the [E-easy] marks good beginner issues,
and [E-rust] marks issues which likely require some familiarity with Rust,
though not necessarily Cranelift-specific or even compiler-specific
experience. [E-compiler-easy] marks issues good for beginners who have
some familiarity with compilers, or are interested in gaining some :-).

See also the [full list of Cranelift labels].

Also, we encourage people to just look around and find things they're
interested in. This a good time to get involved, as there aren't a lot of
things set in stone yet.

//! Support executing the interpreter loop through tail-calls rather than a
//! source-level `loop`.
//!
//! This is an alternative means of executing the interpreter loop of Pulley.
//! The other method is in `match_loop.rs` which is a `loop` over a `match`
//! (more-or-less). This file instead transitions between opcodes with
//! tail-calls.
//!
//! At this time this module is more performant but disabled by default. Rust
//! does not have guaranteed tail call elimination at this time so this is not
//! a suitable means of writing an interpreter loop. That being said this is
//! included nonetheless for us to experiment and analyze with.
//!
//! There are two methods of using this module:
//!
//! * `RUSTFLAGS=--cfg=pulley_assume_llvm_makes_tail_calls` - this compilation
//!   flag indicates that we should assume that LLVM will optimize to making
//!   tail calls for things that look like tail calls. Practically this
//!   probably only happens with `--release` and for popular native
//!   architectures. It's up to the person compiling to manually
//!   audit/verify/test that TCO is happening.
//!
//! * `RUSTFLAGS=--cfg=pulley_tail_calls` - this compilation flag indicates that
//!   Rust's nightly-only support for guaranteed tail calls should be used. This
//!   uses the `become` keyword, for example. At this time this feature of Rust
//!   is highly experimental and not even complete. It only passes `cargo check`
//!   at this time but doesn't actually run anywhere.

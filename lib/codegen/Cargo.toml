# It is a goal of the cretonne-codegen crate to have minimal external dependencies.
# Please don't add any unless they are essential to the task of creating binary
# machine code. Integration tests that need external dependencies can be
# accomodated in `tests`.

[features]
# The "std" feature enables use of libstd. The "core" feature enables use
# of some minimal std-like replacement libraries. At least one of these two
# features need to be enabled.

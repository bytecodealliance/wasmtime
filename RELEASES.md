## 30.0.1

Released 2025-02-21.

### Fixed

* Fixes an issue building the `cranelift-assembler-x64` crate on Windows
  when the Rust toolchain is on a different drive than the project using
  `wasmtime`. For more details, see the [Zulip discussion]. [#10270]

## 30.0.0

Released 2025-02-20.

### Added

* New `wasmtime-wasi-io` crate provides a `#![no_std]` wasi:io implementation,
  factored out of `wasmtime-wasi`. Users of `wasmtime-wasi` don't have to
  depend on this new crate.
  [#10036](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10036)

* Wasmtime's interpreter, Pulley, is now complete and has been listed as
  [tier 2].

  [#10095](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10095)

* Wasmtime's CI now checks that the repository builds for `aarch64-apple-ios`.
  Note that no tests are run for this target, so it's still [tier 3].
  [#9888](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9888)

* Winch's support for AArch64 and simd on x64 have continued to progress
  well. Winch additionally now fully supports the `threads` WebAssembly
  proposal.

* The `memory64` WebAssembly feature is now enabled by default. This WebAssembly
  proposal is now considered a [tier 1] feature.
  [#9937](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9937)
  [#10159](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10159)

* Wasmtime's full test suite and CI now includes 32-bit platforms such as x86
  and armv7 Linux. These platforms have been added to [tier 3] status and use
  Pulley as their execution backend.
  [#10025](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10025)

* Initial experimental support for WASIp3 and async features of the Component
  Model have started to land. These features are not yet ready for
  general-purpose use.

  in addition to CLI options.
  [#9811](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9811)
  [#10132](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10132)

* Initial support for a new assembler on x64 has been added.
  [#10110](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10110)
  [#10178](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10178)

### Changed

* `wasmtime-wasi` split the `WasiView` trait into `IoView` and `WasiView`, and
  `wasmtime-wasi-http` re-uses `IoView` in `WasiHttpView`. Details on porting
  for embedders in PR.
  [#10016](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10016)

* `wasmtime-wasi` renamed some exported types and traits. Embedders which use
  `Pollable`, `InputStream`, `OutputStream`, `Subscribe`, `HostInputStream`,
  `HostOutputStream`, `PollableFuture`, or `ClosureFuture` from that crate
  will need to rename those imports to their new names, describe in PR.
  [#10036](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10036)

* Components using a 64-bit linear memory should never have worked before, but
  they're now rejected earlier in the validation process.
  [#9952](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9952)

* Module validation is now deterministic in the face of multiple errors.
  [#9947](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9947)

* Wasmtime's minimum supported version of Rust is now 1.82.0.
  [#9956](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9956)

* Cranelift will now deduplicate `trap[n]z` instructions.
  [#10004](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10004)

* The `--emit-clif` option to `wasmtime compile` now emits post-optimization
  CLIF.
  [#10011](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10011)

* The `signals-based-traps` Cargo feature has been removed in favor of
  auto-detection of available features based on the `#[cfg]` directives
  available for the target platform.
  [#9941](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9941)

* The `async_stack_zeroing` configuration knob now covers all stack allocations,
  not just those from the pooling allocator.
  [#10027](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10027)

* Wasmtime should work-by-default on more platforms, even those where Cranelift
  has no support for the architecture. This is done by ensuring some
  architecture and platform-specific bits are removed on unknown platforms (and
  Pulley is used instead).
  [#10107](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10107)

* Wasmtime now compiles on platforms missing 64-bit atomics.

### Fixed

* Fixed a missing case for `Ref::matches_ty` should return `true`.
  [#9985](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9985)

* A bug with using the `single_pass` register allocation algorithm on x64/s390x
  has been fixed by refactoring how branches are represented.
  [#10086](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10086)
  [#10087](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10087)

* A bug with argument extensions on riscv64 has been fixed.
  [#10069](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10069)

* The `PartialEq` implementation for `RegisteredType` has been fixed.
  [#10091](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10091)

* The output of `component::bindgen!` now works with `#![no_std]` crates.
  [#10105](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10105)

* Fix `wasmtime wast` when combined with `--fuel`.
  [#10121](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10121)

* The `wat` feature of the C API is now plumbed correctly in a few more
  locations.
  [#10124](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10124)

* Spurious wake-ups in `blocking_*` methods of `InputStream` and `OutputStream`
  have been fixed.
  [#10113](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10113)

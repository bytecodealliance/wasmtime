## 36.0.1

Released 2025-08-20.

### Added

* Accessors for internal WASI-related contexts are added to

  release.

## 36.0.0

Released 2025-08-20.

### Added

* Cranelift's has initial support for inlining between functions. Wasmtime
  additionally now has support for inlining as well, for example between modules
  in a component.
  [#11210](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11210)
  [#11239](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11239)
  [#11228](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11228)
  [#11269](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11269)
  [#11283](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11283)

* The async proposal for the Component Model is now fully implemented in
  Wasmtime with a number of WASIp3 interfaces implemented. The implementation
  is still off-by-default and the implementation of WASIp3 is not fully
  complete, but is remains suitable for testing.

  [#11325](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11325)

### Changed

* Users who implemented `WasiHttpView::is_forbidden_header` from
  `wasmtime-wasi-http` now need to include `DEFAULT_FORBIDDEN_HEADERS`, e.g.
  `DEFAULT_FORBIDDEN_HEADERS.contains(name) || name.as_str() ==
  "custom-forbidden-header"`
  [#11292](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11292)

* Cranelift's incremental cache has received some optimizations.
  [#11186](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11186)

* Wasmtime's internal implementations of WebAssembly primitives has been
  refactored to be modeled with safer internal primitives.

  [#11320](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11320)

* Detection of native hardware features has been refactored on s390x.
  [#11220](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11220)

* Further progress has been made towards an implementation of the WebAssembly
  exceptions proposal, although it is not yet complete.
  [#11230](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11230)
  [#11321](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11321)

* Cranelift's assembler for x64 now supports EVEX encoding.
  [#11153](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11153)
  [#11270](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11270)
  [#11303](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11303)

* The default implementation of `send_request` in the `wasmtime-wasi-http` crate
  is now behind an on-by-default feature gate.
  [#11323](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11323)

* Configuration of the `bindgen!` macro has been redesigned to more consistently
  configure per-function options such as whether or not it's async.
  [#11328](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11328)

* Initial support fo `mutatis` has been added to Wasmtime's fuzzers.
  [#11290](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11290)

* The `debug-builtins` crate feature of `wasmtime` no compiles on `no_std`
  targets.
  [#11304](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11304)

### Fixed

* Deserializing external modules no long unnecessarily requires the allocation
  to be aligned.
  [#11306](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11306)

* A CMake linker error and warning when using the C API on macOS has been fixed.
  [#11293](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11293)
  [#11315](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11315)

* The C API declaration of `wasmtime_component_linker_instance_add_func` has
  been fixed.
  [#11327](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11327)

* The calculation of reachable DWARF has been fixed.
  [#11338](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11338)

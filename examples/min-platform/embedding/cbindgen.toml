// Platform support for Wasmtime's `no_std` build.
//
// This header file is what Wasmtime will rely on when it does not otherwise
// have support for the native platform. This can happen with `no_std` binaries
// for example where the traditional Unix-or-Windows implementation is not
// suitable.
//
// Embedders are expected to implement the symbols defined in this header file.
// These symbols can be defined either in C/C++ or in Rust (using
// `#[unsafe(no_mangle)]`).
//
// Note that there are some `#define`s here which can be added before this
// header file is included to indicate how Wasmtime was built. This corresponds
// to the `wasmtime` crate's Cargo features where if the feature is disabled
// then the symbols will not be required.
//
// * `WASMTIME_SIGNALS_BASED_TRAPS` - corresponds to `signals-based-traps`
//
// Some more information about this header can additionally be found at
// <https://docs.wasmtime.dev/stability-platform-support.html>.

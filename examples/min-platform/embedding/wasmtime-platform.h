// Platform support for Wasmtime's `no_std` build.
//
// This header file is what Wasmtime will rely on when it does not otherwise
// have support for the native platform. This can happen with `no_std` binaries
// for example where the traditional Unix-or-Windows implementation is not
// suitable.
//
// Embedders are expected to implement the symbols defined in this header file.
// These symbols can be defined either in C/C++ or in Rust (using
// `#[no_mangle]`).
//
// Note that there are some `#define`s here which can be added before this
// header file is included to indicate how Wasmtime was built. This corresponds
// to the `wasmtime` crate's Cargo features where if the feature is disabled
// then the symbols will not be required.
//
// * `WASMTIME_SIGNALS_BASED_TRAPS` - corresponds to `signals-based-traps`
//
// Some more information about this header can additionally be found at
// <https://docs.wasmtime.dev/stability-platform-support.html>.

 * Handler function for traps in Wasmtime passed to `wasmtime_init_traps`.
 *
 * This function is invoked whenever a trap is caught by the system. For
 * example this would be invoked during a signal handler on Linux. This
 * function is passed a number of parameters indicating information about the
 * trap:
 *
 * * `ip` - the instruction pointer at the time of the trap.
 * * `fp` - the frame pointer register's value at the time of the trap.
 * * `has_faulting_addr` - whether this trap is associated with an access
 *   violation (e.g. a segfault) meaning memory was accessed when it shouldn't
 *   be. If this is `true` then the next parameter is filled in.
 * * `faulting_addr` - if `has_faulting_addr` is true then this is the address
 *   that was attempted to be accessed. Otherwise this value is not used.
 *
 * If this function returns then the trap was not handled by Wasmtime. This
 * means that it's left up to the embedder how to deal with the trap/signal
 * depending on its default behavior. This could mean forwarding to a
 * non-Wasmtime handler, aborting the process, logging then crashing, etc. The
 * meaning of a trap that's not handled by Wasmtime depends on the context in
 * which the trap was generated.
 *
 * When this function does not return it's because `wasmtime_longjmp` is
 * used to handle a Wasm-based trap.

# A script to build the release artifacts of Wasmtime into the `target`
# directory. For now this is the CLI and the C API. Note that this script only
# produces the artifacts through Cargo and doesn't package things up. That's
# intended for the `build-tarballs.sh` script.
#
# This script takes a Rust target as its first input and optionally a parameter
# afterwards which can be "-min" to indicate that a minimal build should be
# produced with as many features as possible stripped out.

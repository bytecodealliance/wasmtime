This crate is a Rust implementation of zlib compression/decompression and has
been used by default by the Rust standard library for quite some time. It's also
a default dependency of the popular `backtrace` crate for decompressing debug
information. This crate forbids unsafe code and does not otherwise access system
resources. It's originally a port of the `miniz.c` library as well, and given
its own longevity should be relatively hardened against some of the more common
compression-related issues.

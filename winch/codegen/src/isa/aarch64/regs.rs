/// Shadow stack pointer register.
///
/// The shadow stack pointer (SSP) is used as the base for memory addressing
/// to workaround Aarch64's constraint on the stack pointer 16-byte
/// alignment for memory addressing. This allows word-size loads and
/// stores.  It's always assumed that the real stack pointer (SP) is
/// 16-byte unaligned; the only exceptions to this assumption are:
///
/// * The function prologue and epilogue in which we use SP
///   for addressing, assuming that the 16-byte alignment is respected.
/// * Call sites, in which the code generation process explicitly ensures that
///   the stack pointer is 16-byte aligned.
/// * Code that could result in signal handling, like loads/stores.
///
/// SSP is utilized for space allocation. After each allocation, its value is
/// copied to SP, ensuring that SP accurately reflects the allocated space.
/// Accessing memory below SP may lead to undefined behavior, as this memory can
/// be overwritten by interrupts and signal handlers.
///
/// This approach requires copying the value of SSP into SP every time SSP
/// changes, more explicitly, this happens at three main locations:
///
/// 1. After space is allocated, to respect the requirement of avoiding
///    addressing space below SP.
/// 2. At function epilogue.
/// 3. After explicit SP is emitted (code that could result in signal handling).
///
/// +-----------+      Prologue:
/// |           |      * Save SSP (callee-saved)
/// +-----------+----- * SP at function entry (after prologue, slots for FP and LR)
/// |           |      * Copy the value of SP to SSP
/// |           |
/// +-----------+----- SSP after reserving stack space for locals and arguments
/// |           |      Copy the value of SSP to SP
/// |           |
/// +-----------+----- SSP after a push
/// |           |      Copy the value of SSP to SP
/// |           |      
/// |           |       
/// |           |
/// |           |      Epilogue:
/// |           |      * Copy SSP to SP
/// +-----------+----- * Restore SSP (callee-saved)
/// +-----------+      
///
/// In summary, the following invariants must be respected:
///
/// * SSP is considered primary, and must be used to allocate and deallocate
///   stack space(e.g. push, pop). This operation must always be followed by
///   a copy of SSP to SP.
/// * SP must never be used to address memory except when we are certain that
///   the required alignment is respected (e.g.  during the prologue and epilogue)
/// * SP must be explicitly aligned when code could result in signal handling.
/// * The value of SP is copied to SSP when entering a function.
/// * The value of SSP doesn't change between
///   function calls (as it's callee saved), compliant with
///   Aarch64's ABI.
/// * SSP is not available during register allocation.
